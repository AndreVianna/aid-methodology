contracts:
  - "Python 3.11+ required by the generator pipeline (tomllib stdlib dependency)"
  - "No third-party Python packages in the generator (stdlib only)"
  - "The PyPI `aid-installer` package requires Python >=3.8 and builds with hatchling; the npm `aid-installer` package requires Node >=18. Both have zero runtime dependencies."
  - "package.json + pyproject.toml exist ONLY under `packages/npm/` and `packages/pypi/` (the published installer shims); none exists for application code"
changelog:
  - 2026-06-23: Migrated by migrate-kb-frontmatter.sh: intent retired, objective/summary/sources added
  - 2026-06-22: housekeep KB-DELTA (Q30) — work-005-profile-generator-simplify (merged). Python row: dropped the deleted test_copilot_emitter.py / test_antigravity_emitter.py mention; now points at the 7 generator scripts (render.py copy core + run_generator.py). Build-commands block: replaced the now-invalid `render_skills.py --output-root ...` per-tree example (the per-type renderers were deleted; render.py's CLI only exposes --self-test) with the `render.py --self-test` invocation. Build-system + config tables: run_generator now `render_profile` single copy pass; profile-TOML section list shrunk ([layout]/[agent.frontmatter]/[skill.frontmatter]/[filename_map]/[extras] dropped); retired the copilot-agent/antigravity-rule agent_format values + the Cursor [extras.rules] mention (all now agent_format=markdown).
  - 2026-06-05: work-002-auto-installer — the repo gained its first `package.json` (`packages/npm/package.json`) and `pyproject.toml` (`packages/pypi/pyproject.toml`, hatchling build), so the former "no package.json/pyproject at any level" claim is now FALSE and was corrected; added Node 18+ (npm `aid-installer`) and Python 3.8+ (PyPI `aid-installer`, hatchling) as build/packaging tooling, both zero runtime deps; replaced setup.sh/setup.ps1 evidence with the new `aid` CLI (`bin/aid` + `install.sh` / `bin/aid.ps1` + `install.ps1`).
  - 2026-06-03: §9a T3-count strip — removed all hardcoded file-count and line-count figures from frontmatter intent, Languages table, Development Tools table, Build System table, Configuration Files table, and Testing Infrastructure; replaced aggregate counts with pointer to `.aid/generated/project-index.md`; removed stale branch name
  - 2026-06-01: post-merge update for work-001-add-providers (PRs #42/#43/#44) — generator Python files 11→12 (added test_copilot_emitter.py + test_antigravity_emitter.py); TOML config files 3→5 profiles (added copilot-cli + antigravity); byte-identical mirror count canonical+.claude+3 → canonical+.claude+5 profiles
  - 2026-05-27: Initial frontmatter added during cycle-1 FIX Phase B

# Technology Stack

> Concrete inventory of languages, runtimes, libraries, build tools, and dev tooling used
> by the AID-methodology repository. There is no shipped application — this repo is a
> code/document generator + a multi-tool install bundle. Versions come from the source
> files where they are declared; "unpinned" means the tool/library version is unstated

## Languages

| Language | Version | Source file / evidence |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| **Markdown** | CommonMark + GFM tables (assumed; no validator pinned) | All docs, skills, agents, templates, recipes. For counts see `.aid/generated/project-index.md` `## Language Breakdown`. |
| **Bash (shell)** | bash 4+ (uses `declare -A` associative arrays, `[[ ]]`, `${var:-}`) | Example: `lib/aid-install-core.sh` (the install-core engine sourced by `bin/aid`); every `canonical/scripts/**/*.sh`. |
| **Python** | 3.11+ (required for `tomllib` stdlib) | The 7 generator scripts under `.claude/skills/generate-profile/scripts/` — the `render.py` copy core + `run_generator.py` entrypoint. Pinned by `.claude/skills/generate-profile/scripts/render_lib.py` "Requirements: Python 3.11+ (tomllib is stdlib; no third-party deps)" and `aid_profile.py` "Requirements: Python 3.11+ (tomllib is stdlib from 3.11)". |
| **JavaScript (ES modules + plain)** | ES2020+ (no explicit pin); `.mjs` for ESM scripts | `canonical/scripts/summarize/validate-diagrams.mjs`, `contrast-check.mjs`; `canonical/templates/knowledge-summary/lightbox.js`, `mermaid-init.js`. |
| **PowerShell** | 5.1+ | `bin/aid.ps1`, `install.ps1`, `lib/AidInstallCore.psm1`, `canonical/scripts/summarize/assemble-3part.ps1`. PowerShell 5.1+ pin from `README.md` `### Bootstrap the `aid` CLI` (Windows). |
| **CSS** | CSS3 (custom properties, `:focus-visible`, `@media (forced-colors)`, `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)`) | Single canonical source `canonical/templates/knowledge-summary/component-css.css` rendered into the render-target trees: canonical + `.claude` dogfood + 5 profile trees = **7 copies** on disk (a runtime `.aid/templates/` copy makes 8 total). |
| **HTML** | HTML5 (semantic landmarks: `<header role="banner">`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) | `canonical/templates/knowledge-summary/html-skeleton.html` rendered into canonical + `.claude` dogfood + 5 profile trees = **7 copies** on disk (a runtime `.aid/templates/` copy makes 8). |
| **TOML** | TOML 1.0 (Python `tomllib` parser implies 1.0) | 5 profile config files (`profiles/*.toml`) + 22 Codex agent definitions (`profiles/codex/.codex/agents/*.toml`). |
| **YAML** | YAML 1.2 (per `canonical/templates/settings.yml` "Format: YAML 1.2.") | `canonical/templates/settings.yml` + mirrors. Also used as Markdown frontmatter throughout. |
| **JSON** | RFC 8259 (Claude Code uses standard JSON) | `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`. |
| **JSON Lines** | Per `canonical/EMISSION-MANIFEST.md` `## Line-Ending and Trailing-Newline Rule` — LF-only, one record per line | Used by `profiles/{tool}/emission-manifest.jsonl`. |

File and line counts for all languages live in `.aid/generated/project-index.md` `## Language Breakdown` (regenerated by `build-project-index.sh`). Do not hand-maintain counts in this document.

## Frameworks & Libraries

This repository has **no application-language frameworks** (no React, no Spring, no
Django, etc.). The only runtime libraries are:

| Library | Version | Purpose | Source file / evidence |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------------|
| **Mermaid** | Pinned to v11.15.0 (constant `PINNED_VERSION`); downloaded once from jsdelivr CDN and cached; SHA-verified against `EXPECTED_SHA256` on both cache-hit and post-download paths | Diagram rendering inside `/aid-summarize`-generated HTML; inlined into the single-file output so the viewer works fully offline | `canonical/scripts/summarize/fetch-mermaid.sh` `PINNED_VERSION` / `EXPECTED_SHA256` |
| **(Implicit) jsdelivr CDN** | n/a — download URL: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@11.15.0/dist/mermaid.min.js` | Source of the pinned Mermaid bundle that gets cached + inlined | `canonical/scripts/summarize/fetch-mermaid.sh` `URL=` |

The **generator** uses Python **stdlib only** — `tomllib`, `hashlib`, `json`, `pathlib`, `re`, `dataclasses`,
`argparse`, `tempfile`, `filecmp`, `sys`. Confirmed by `render_lib.py` `import` block; there is no
`requirements.txt` or `setup.py`, and the only `pyproject.toml` in the repo belongs to the
**published installer package** (`packages/pypi/pyproject.toml`, hatchling build), not to the generator.

JavaScript uses **no npm dependencies** — `canonical/templates/knowledge-summary/lightbox.js`
is a self-contained IIFE; `canonical/scripts/summarize/validate-diagrams.mjs` and
`contrast-check.mjs` run with Node's built-in modules only. The **only** `package.json` in the repo
is the **published installer package** (`packages/npm/package.json`), which declares an empty
`"dependencies": {}` — its `bin/aid.js` shim runs on Node built-ins (`child_process`, `path`, `os`, `fs`)
with zero third-party packages.

## Package Manager

| Tool | Version | Lock file |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **None for application code** | — | — |
| **npm** (publishes the `aid-installer` shim; not used to install application deps) | declares `"dependencies": {}` | No `package-lock.json` is committed; the package vendors `bin/` + `lib/` via its `prepack` hook (`packages/npm/scripts/vendor.js`). `packages/npm/package.json`. |
| **pip / pipx + hatchling** (builds + publishes the `aid-installer` shim) | `requires-python >=3.8`; build via `hatchling` | No lock file; `packages/pypi/pyproject.toml` `[build-system] requires = ["hatchling"]`, with a custom build hook (`scripts/vendor.py`) that force-vendors the CLI payload into the sdist. |
| **Implicit: jsDelivr CDN (pinned)** (used only by `/aid-summarize` to download the **pinned** Mermaid release `v11.15.0`, SHA-256-verified; the prior npm-registry "discover latest" call was removed when C1 was resolved 2026-05-29) | n/a | The SHA-verified library is cached at `.aid/knowledge/.cache/mermaid.min.js` (per `canonical/scripts/summarize/fetch-mermaid.sh`). |

A `package.json` and a `pyproject.toml` **do** exist — but **only** under `packages/npm/` and
`packages/pypi/` (the published installer shims). There is still no `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`
for application code, and no `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`, or `pom.xml` anywhere
(see `project-structure.md` `## Languages NOT Present`).

## Runtime

| Runtime | Version | How detected |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Python** | 3.11+ | `.claude/skills/generate-profile/SKILL.md` "Python 3.11+ is available" Pre-flight check (`python --version`); `render_lib.py` "Requirements: Python 3.11+"; `aid_profile.py` "Requirements: Python 3.11+". Required for `tomllib` stdlib. |
| **Bash** | 4+ (associative arrays) | `bin/aid` shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bash`; `lib/aid-install-core.sh` engine; every `canonical/scripts/**/*.sh`. Per `README.md` Linux/macOS bootstrap: `curl … \| bash`. |
| **PowerShell** | 5.1+ | `README.md` Windows bootstrap pin "Windows (PowerShell 5.1+)"; `bin/aid.ps1` + `install.ps1` + `lib/AidInstallCore.psm1`. |
| **Node.js** | 18+ (optional — only for `/aid-summarize` diagram validators) | `README.md` `### Runtime requirements`: "Node 18+ is optional — only `/aid-summarize` uses it, for diagram validation." `.mjs` files imply ESM support (Node 14+ minimum). |
| **Git** | unpinned (any modern version) | `README.md` `### Runtime requirements`: "Git" listed as a runtime requirement; `.claude/skills/generate-profile/SKILL.md` "git working tree" Pre-flight runs `git rev-parse --git-dir`. |
| **One of: Claude Code / OpenAI Codex CLI / Cursor IDE / GitHub Copilot CLI / Antigravity** | unpinned (host-tool-specific) | `README.md` `### Runtime requirements`: "One or more host AI tools." End-user runtime; required to invoke the slash commands. The 5 install profiles map 1:1 to these host tools (`profiles/*.toml`). |

## Build System

| Tool | Config file location | Purpose |
|------|----------------------|---------|
| **`run_generator.py`** | `.claude/skills/generate-profile/scripts/run_generator.py` | The build. Iterates `profiles/*.toml` (5 profiles), calls `render_profile` (a single `render.py` copy pass) per profile, performs the pure-mirror deletion pass, writes one emission manifest per profile, then runs VERIFY (deterministic) (hard) and VERIFY (advisory) (advisory). |
| **Per-tool profile TOMLs** | `profiles/claude-code.toml`, `profiles/codex.toml`, `profiles/cursor.toml`, `profiles/copilot-cli.toml`, `profiles/antigravity.toml` (5 profiles) | Per-host conventions (shrunk schema, work-005): top-level `root_dir` / `root_file` / `agent_format` (∈ markdown/toml; `toml` dormant for Codex) + `[tool_names]`, `[model_tiers]`, `[capabilities]`. The former `[layout]` / `[agent.frontmatter]` / `[skill.frontmatter]` / `[filename_map]` / `[extras]` sections were dropped — see `schemas.md §9`. |
| **Emission manifest spec** | `canonical/EMISSION-MANIFEST.md` | Authoritative spec for the manifest format (JSONL, LF-only, sentinel first line `{"_manifest_version": 1}`, sorted by `dst`). |
| **End-user installer** | `bin/aid` (Bash) / `bin/aid.ps1` (PowerShell) | The persistent global `aid` CLI that copies a built profile tree into a target project (not a build per se — consumes the rendered `profiles/` trees). |
| **Installer-package builds** | `packages/npm/scripts/vendor.js` (npm `prepack`) / `packages/pypi/scripts/vendor.py` (hatchling build hook) | Vendor the `bin/` + `lib/` CLI payload into the published npm / PyPI `aid-installer` packages. |
| **Release packager** | `release.sh` | Builds the five per-profile tarballs + the `aid-cli-v<VERSION>.tar.gz` CLI bundle + the two libs + `SHA256SUMS`, then `gh release create`. Tag-triggered via `.github/workflows/release.yml`. |

### Build Commands

```bash
# Full build (renders canonical → all 5 install trees + runs VERIFY (deterministic)/(advisory))
python .claude/skills/generate-profile/scripts/run_generator.py

# Run the copy-core self-tests (8 in-process tests: byte-identity + determinism + remap)
python .claude/skills/generate-profile/scripts/render.py --self-test --canonical-root .

# Build verification (byte-identical re-render audit; hard gate)
python .claude/skills/generate-profile/scripts/verify_deterministic.py
```

Source: `run_generator.py`.

### Lint Commands

This repository has **no language linters** (no ESLint, no flake8, no shellcheck config; the
only `pyproject.toml` is the PyPI `aid-installer` build manifest under `packages/pypi/`, which
declares no linter `[tool.*]` config). Quality is enforced by:

```bash
# Rebuild file inventory used by Discovery
bash canonical/scripts/kb/build-project-index.sh --root . --output .aid/generated/project-index.md

# Canonical helper-script test suites (currently 24 suites) — run all via the aggregator
bash tests/run-all.sh                                 # discovers tests/canonical/test-*.sh by glob

# Or run an individual suite
bash tests/canonical/test-writeback-state.sh
bash tests/canonical/test-delivery-gate-aggregate.sh
bash tests/canonical/test-compute-block-radius.sh
bash tests/canonical/test-parse-recipe.sh             # slowest suite — needs timeout ≥180s
bash tests/canonical/test-read-setting.sh
bash tests/canonical/test-fetch-mermaid.sh
bash tests/canonical/test-grade.sh
```

**KB claim verification** is performed by `aid-reviewer` dispatched from
`/aid-discover REVIEW` state (see `canonical/agents/aid-reviewer/AGENT.md`).
The former `canonical/scripts/kb/verify-claims.sh` was deleted in cycle-1 (closure
recorded in `tech-debt.md` changelog).

There is **no auto-fix linter**. Quality gates are the AID skills themselves: `aid-discover`
adversarial review, `aid-execute` two-tier review per task + per delivery, `aid-deploy`
verification step.

Each script above has **seven byte-identical copies** on disk (canonical + dogfood `.claude/`
+ 5 profile trees: claude-code, codex, cursor, copilot-cli, antigravity) — the high shell-file
count relative to the unique script count is by design (per-tool mirroring); see
`project-structure.md` `## Unusual Structure Notes` "mirror" note. For current shell-file totals
see `.aid/generated/project-index.md` `## Language Breakdown`.

## Testing Infrastructure

| Tool | Version | Purpose | Config / location |
