  Architectural map of the AID-methodology repository: the canonical→render→install pipeline
  that emits one canonical source into three byte-identical host-tool install trees (Claude Code,
  Codex, Cursor), the phase-to-skill mapping across 8 pipeline phases, the agent-tier model
  (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku), the Thin-Router SKILL.md pattern, and the two-tier review + parallel
  pool dispatch execution model. Read this to understand how the methodology pieces hang together;
  for raw file inventory see project-structure.md.
contracts:
  - "10 AID skills listed in Dispatch table"
  - "22 specialist agents across 3 tiers (10 Opus, 9 Sonnet, 3 Haiku)"
  - "3 rendered install trees: claude-code, codex, cursor"
changelog:
  - 2026-05-27: Initial frontmatter added during cycle-1 FIX Phase B

# Architecture

> Architectural map of the AID-methodology repository — how the pieces fit together, what
> patterns govern them, and how data flows from the single canonical source out to three
> tool-specific install trees. For raw inventory see `project-structure.md`; this document
> describes the *shape*.

## Project Type

**Multi-tool methodology distribution + single-source code generator** — a single-package,
single-branch monorepo whose deliverable is **documentation rendered into three
host-tool install bundles**. There is no application runtime; the project ships:

1. The AID methodology specification (`methodology/aid-methodology.md`, 1,070 lines).
2. Ten skills + 22 agents + templates + recipes + helper scripts, authored once in
   `canonical/` and rendered into three byte-identical install trees
   (`profiles/{claude-code,codex,cursor}/`).
3. An optional offline HTML Knowledge Base viewer (the UI surface — see
   `canonical/templates/knowledge-summary/` for the HTML/CSS/JS bundle).

Evidence:
- `project-structure.md` §Primary Purpose — "This repo has no application code — it ships
  skills, agents, templates, and recipes."
- `README.md` "It ships as an install bundle for three AI coding tools …".
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` confirms repo-structure table.

```

Evidence: `project-structure.md` `## Top-Level Directory Tree (depth 3)`;
`canonical/EMISSION-MANIFEST.md` `## Asset Kinds` (asset-kind mapping);
`coding-standards.md §7a` (never-edit-profiles rule).

## Architectural Pattern

The project applies **four interlocking patterns**:

### 1. Single-source compilation with pure-mirror safety boundary

The dominant pattern. **`canonical/` is the only place a maintainer edits**; `run_generator.py`
calls per-asset renderers (`render_agents.py`, `render_skills.py`, `render_templates.py`,
`render_canonical_scripts.py`, `render_recipes.py`) to emit byte-identical output into each profile's
install tree. Output paths are recorded per profile in `{profile}/emission-manifest.jsonl`;
the deletion pass only removes files that **were** in the previous manifest but are no longer
in the current one. Files outside any manifest are never touched.

Evidence:
- `run_generator.py` `for profile_path in sorted(profiles_dir.glob('*.toml'))` — the live
  render loop (load profile → render → diff → delete → write manifest).
- `canonical/EMISSION-MANIFEST.md` `## Safety-Boundary Semantics` — the four-step
  load/diff/delete/write sequence.
- `.claude/skills/aid-generate/scripts/render_lib.py` `_MANIFEST_VERSION` +
  `_FILENAME_PLACEHOLDERS` — manifest sentinel + placeholder regex; the manifest is JSONL
  with a `{"_manifest_version": 1}` first line, sorted by `dst` for byte-stable diffs.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `coding-standards.md §7a` — "Never edit `profiles/{claude-code,codex,
  cursor}/` directly — edit canonical/ and run `python run_generator.py`."

### 2. Thin-Router state machine (per skill)

Every `aid-*` skill is a **state-machine orchestrator**. The top-level `SKILL.md` is a
≤~360-line *router* — Dispatch table + Pre-flight + State Detection only — that delegates
per-state logic to `references/state-{name}.md` files. Each `/aid-<skill>` invocation
detects which state to enter from disk, executes that one state, and exits. No
auto-advance; the human re-invokes the skill for the next state.

Evidence:
- `coding-standards.md §7b` — "When a SKILL.md grows past ~200 lines, extract per-state
  bodies into references/state-{name}.md; keep the router as Dispatch table + Pre-flight +
  State Detection only." Total skill body lines: 2,242 (per `metrics.md`).
- `.claude/skills/aid-discover/SKILL.md` `State machine for this skill` — explicit
  `[GENERATE]→[REVIEW]→[Q-AND-A]→[FIX]→[APPROVAL]→[DONE]` machine.
- `.claude/skills/aid-summarize/SKILL.md` `## State Detection` — explicit `PREFLIGHT→
  STALE-CHECK→PROFILE→GENERATE→VALIDATE→MANUAL-CHECKLIST→FIX→APPROVAL→WRITEBACK→DONE` machine.
- `profiles/claude-code.toml` `decomposition = "references"` enforces the
  state-file decomposition at render time.

Skill line counts (canonical): see `.aid/generated/metrics.md` for the authoritative
per-skill breakdown (generated by `build-metrics.sh`). Total: 2,242 lines across 10 skills.

### 3. Three-tier agent dispatch with reviewer-tier-≥-executor invariant

22 specialist agents split across three model tiers (Large / Medium / Small), mapped per
profile in `[model_tiers]`. Skills dispatch agents via the host tool's Agent capability;
the reviewer's tier is always ≥ the executor's so the writer never grades its own work.

Evidence:
- `README.md` `## The Agent Model — three tiers` — three-tier diagram (10 Large, 9 Medium,
  3 Small).
- `profiles/claude-code.toml` `[model_tiers]` — `large=opus`, `medium=sonnet`, `small=haiku`.
- `profiles/codex.toml` `[model_tiers.large]` — split syntax with `reasoning_effort`
  (gpt-5.5 high / gpt-5.4 medium / gpt-5.4-mini low).
- `profiles/cursor.toml` `[model_tiers]` — same aliases as Claude Code.
- `README.md` `### Skill → agent dispatch` — skill→agent dispatch diagram + the
  "Reviewer's tier ≥ Executor's" invariant.

### 4. Area-STATE consolidation (FR2)

Per the area-STATE consolidation rule, each runtime area uses **one** `STATE.md` as its
state hub (Discovery's hub is `.aid/knowledge/STATE.md`; per-work hub is
`.aid/{work}/STATE.md`). Legacy per-feature `STATE.md` and per-task `STATE.md` files are
retired.

Evidence:
- `coding-standards.md §7e` — "Each `.aid/{work}/STATE.md` is the per-area state hub;
  legacy per-feature `STATE.md` and per-task `STATE.md` files are retired."
- `profiles/claude-code.toml`, `profiles/codex.toml`, `profiles/cursor.toml` —
  `reviewer_output_file = "STATE.md"` (was `DISCOVERY-STATE.md` / `DISCOVERY-GRADE.md`
  pre-FR2).
- `profiles/cursor/.cursor/rules/aid-methodology.mdc` `## Workspace Structure (per FR2
  area-STATE rule)` — the always-on Cursor rule encoding the three-area rule.

## Module Boundaries

| Module | Path | Responsibility | Depends on |
|--------|------|----------------|------------|
| **Methodology spec** | `methodology/aid-methodology.md` | Authoritative human-readable methodology document (1,070 lines, version 3.1) | — |

| **Generator harness** | `.claude/skills/aid-generate/scripts/render_lib.py` + `aid_profile.py` | Profile parsing, placeholder substitution, manifest read/write/diff, SHA-256 fingerprinting | Python stdlib only (`tomllib`, `hashlib`, `json`, `pathlib`) |
| **Asset renderers** | `render_agents.py`, `render_skills.py`, `render_templates.py`, `render_canonical_scripts.py`, `render_recipes.py` | One renderer per asset kind; each reads `canonical/<kind>/` and writes into the profile-specific install path | `render_lib`, `aid_profile` |
| **VERIFY (deterministic)** | `verify_deterministic.py` | Byte-identical re-render audit + file-presence audit + frontmatter parse | All renderers (re-runs them into a scratch dir) |
| **VERIFY (advisory)** | `verify_advisory.py` | Non-fatal advisory checks logged separately | `render_lib`, `aid_profile` |
| **Manifest safety tests** | `test_manifest_safety.py` | Generator self-tests for the deletion boundary | `render_lib`, all renderers |
| **Entry point** | `run_generator.py` | 87-line glue: iterate `profiles/*.toml`, run renderers per profile, deletion pass, then VERIFY (deterministic) + VERIFY (advisory) | All of the above |
| **End-user installer** | `setup.sh` (162 lines), `setup.ps1` (157 lines) | Interactive tool-selection menu; copies the selected `profiles/<tool>/` subtree into a target project | None (pure shell / PowerShell, no Python) |
| **Helper script library** | `canonical/scripts/{config,execute,interview,kb,summarize}/` + top-level `grade.sh` | Runtime helpers used by skill bodies (read-setting, parse-recipe, writeback-state, build-project-index, summarize pipeline, …) | bash 4+, occasionally Node 18+ for `.mjs` validators |
| **Per-tool profile config** | `profiles/{claude-code,codex,cursor}.toml` | Per-host conventions: layout, agent frontmatter shape, model tier names, tool-name remapping, filename map, extras | Consumed by `aid_profile.py` |
| **HTML viewer asset bundle** | `canonical/templates/knowledge-summary/` | The optional offline KB viewer template + JS + CSS + Mermaid init + section profiles — see `canonical/templates/knowledge-summary/` for the bundle details | Inlined Mermaid (pinned v11.15.0, SHA-verified) at render time, fetched by `fetch-mermaid.sh` |

### Install-time data flow (end user running `./setup.sh /target/project`)

`setup.sh` shows a menu of `[1] Claude Code [2] Codex [3] Cursor`, then copies the chosen
`profiles/<tool>/` subtree into the user's project root (`.claude/`, `.codex/` + `.agents/`,
or `.cursor/`). Existing identical files are skipped; differing files prompt unless
`--force` is passed.

Evidence: `setup.sh` `print_menu` (menu loop), `README.md` `### 1. Install` (install
instructions).

### Run-time data flow (end user invoking `/aid-<skill>`)

Slash command → host tool reads the rendered `SKILL.md` from the installed tree
→ skill body (Thin-Router) reads `.aid/{knowledge,work-NNN}/STATE.md` to detect state
→ executes one state's reference body → optionally dispatches a subagent via the host's
Agent tool → writes state back to the appropriate `STATE.md` and exits.

Evidence: `.claude/skills/aid-discover/SKILL.md` `State machine for this skill`;
`.claude/skills/aid-summarize/SKILL.md` `## State Detection`;
`canonical/templates/settings.yml` `execution.max_parallel_tasks`,
`traceability.heartbeat_interval` (runtime knobs).

## Dependency Injection

**No DI framework is used.** This is intentional and consistent with the project type:

- The Python generator is a script-style harness — `run_generator.py` does
  `sys.path.insert(0, '.claude/skills/aid-generate/scripts')` and imports the renderers
  by name. Renderers take their dependencies (`canonical_root: Path`, `profile: Profile`,
  `manifest: EmissionManifest`) as positional arguments.
- The `Profile` dataclass (`.claude/skills/aid-generate/scripts/aid_profile.py` `class Profile`)
  encapsulates per-tool configuration loaded from a `*.toml` file; that loaded object
  is passed explicitly to every renderer.
- Bash helper scripts pass dependencies via CLI arguments or environment variables.
  Example: `canonical/scripts/summarize/assemble-3part.sh` (`PART1="$1"` …) takes `PART1
  MERMAID PART2 OUTPUT` positional args; `canonical/scripts/config/read-setting.sh --path
  ... --default ...` reads from `.aid/settings.yml` keyed by a dotted path.

⚠️ Inferred from code — needs confirmation: the absence of any DI framework is by
design (Python script harness + bash CLI tools) — no plug-in or service-locator
mechanism was found in any source file.

## Entry Points

| Audience | Entry point | What it does |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Maintainer build** | `python run_generator.py` | Renders all 3 install trees from `canonical/`, runs VERIFY (deterministic, hard) + VERIFY (advisory). Evidence: `run_generator.py` (`"""Live generator run` module docstring). |
| **Maintainer one-tree render** | `python .claude/skills/aid-generate/scripts/render_skills.py --canonical-root . --profile profiles/claude-code.toml --output-root profiles/claude-code/.claude` | Renderers are each runnable standalone with `--canonical-root` / `--profile` / `--output-root`. Evidence: `.claude/skills/aid-generate/scripts/render_skills.py` (`# Usage:` header). |
| **Maintainer verify-only** | `python .claude/skills/aid-generate/scripts/verify_deterministic.py` | VERIFY (deterministic) hard gate. Re-renders to scratch tmpdir, byte-compares against committed install trees, parses every frontmatter. Exit code 0 on full pass; 1 on any sub-check failure. Evidence: `verify_deterministic.py` `def run_verify`. |
| **End-user install (Unix)** | `./setup.sh /path/to/your/project [--force]` | Menu-driven copy of selected profiles into a target project. Evidence: `setup.sh` `print_menu`. |
| **End-user install (Windows)** | `.\setup.ps1 C:\path\to\your\project` | PowerShell 5.1+ equivalent of `setup.sh`. |
| **End-user runtime (per skill)** | Slash command `/aid-config`, `/aid-discover`, `/aid-interview`, …, `/aid-summarize` | One per skill (10 slash commands). Each enters at the state detected from disk and exits after one state. |
| **First-time AI agent context** | `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code dogfood) / `AGENTS.md` (Codex, Cursor profiles) | Top-level project-context document — describes purpose, KB location, build/test commands, conventions. |
| **Methodology reader** | `methodology/aid-methodology.md` | The 1,070-line authoritative specification. Read by humans, not by skills directly. |

## Documentation vs. Implementation Discrepancies

The repository's documentation describes a "10 skills + 11 (counting `aid-generate`)"
architecture; observed implementation matches with a few caveats worth flagging:

1. **`aid-generate` is intentionally NOT in `canonical/`.** It lives only at
   `.claude/skills/aid-generate/` and is excluded from the render. `canonical/skills/`
   contains 10 directories (not 11). Reason per `.claude/skills/aid-generate/SKILL.md`
   (`Maintainer-only skill` blockquote): "Edits to this skill are made directly to its files.
   Reason: it generates the install
   trees, so it cannot itself be generated from canonical without a chicken-and-egg
   deployment problem."

2. **Skill total line drift.** The current canonical sources sum to 2,242 lines (per
   `metrics.md`). The rendered `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` set may differ if `canonical/`
   was edited after the last `python run_generator.py` run; run VERIFY (deterministic) to detect drift.

3. **`.aid/work-NNN/` directories referenced by older docs but absent from the project
   index.**
   - Q1 resolution (cycle-1): `.aid/work-001-aid-lite/test-reports/` was never a correct
     home for canonical test scripts; those runners have been removed from documentation.
   - Q2 resolution (cycle-1): `run_generator.py` no longer writes verify reports to
     `.aid/work-002-canonical-generator/`; `report_path=None` was passed to eliminate
     the stale write.

4. **Generator `run_generator.py` previously hardcoded paths to a work directory.**
   Fixed in cycle-1 (Q2 resolution): `run_generator.py` now passes `report_path=None`
   to `run_verify`/`run_advisory`, so no `.aid/work-002-canonical-generator/` directory
   is created or required.

5. **Cursor profile uses `Terminal` instead of `Bash`.** The only non-identity tool-name
   remap across all three profiles (`profiles/cursor.toml` `Bash = "Terminal"`). The renderer
   applies this remap to every `allowed-tools:` frontmatter line — see `coding-standards.md
   §2.3` (per the comment on `profiles/cursor.toml` `Bash = "Terminal"`).

## Access Limitations

None — all files referenced are readable from the working tree. The `run_generator.py`
work-directory write was eliminated in cycle-1 (Q2 resolution), so no directories are
created as side-effects of the build.
