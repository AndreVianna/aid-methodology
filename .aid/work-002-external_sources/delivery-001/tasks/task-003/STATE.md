# Task State -- task-003

[!NOTE]
This is the TASK-LEVEL STATE.md template. All sections are AUTHORED by a single writer:
the delivery branch that owns this task. This file is the SOLE write target for all
per-task mutable state (state cell, review, elapsed, notes, findings, dispatch log).
The parent delivery-NNN/STATE.md ## Tasks State and work-level ## Tasks State are
DERIVED read-only views assembled from this file at read time -- never written directly.

> **Task:** task-003
> **Delivery:** delivery-001
> **Work:** work-002-external_sources

## Task State

<!-- AUTHORED -- written ONLY by `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --field State --value VALUE`.
     State enum (closed; single source of truth):
       Pending | In Progress | In Review | Blocked | Done | Failed | Canceled
     Ordering (most-advanced wins on reconcile):
       Done > Canceled > In Review > In Progress > Blocked > Failed > Pending -->

- **State:** Done
- **Review:** Pending
- **Elapsed:** ~9m
- **Notes:** --

## Quick Check Findings

<!-- AUTHORED -- written by `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --findings ...` during the
     per-task quick-check step of aid-execute. Records the reviewer tier used and all [HIGH]
     and [CRITICAL] findings for this task. [CRITICAL] findings trigger an immediate fix-on-spot;
     [HIGH] findings are deferred to the delivery gate via delivery-NNN-issues.md.
     No grade is recorded here -- grading is per-delivery, not per-task. -->

- **Reviewer Tier:** Small (orchestrator inline safety-net; graded review deferred to delivery gate)
- **Findings:** none for task-003. Executor + orchestrator both ran `test-install-provisioning.sh` -> 44/44 (was 41; +3 CONN cases); PS parity 32/32; PS 5.1 AST lint 0 findings. Observed (OUT OF SCOPE, pre-existing): the `## Stems matched` summary comment at `AidInstallCore.psm1:467-469` already omitted `Workflow` before this change -- a stale comment, not a task-003 defect; left untouched per YAGNI.

## Dispatch Log

<!-- AUTHORED -- appended by the dispatcher on subagent completion (L1+L2+L3 traceability;
     always-on, never optional). One row per dispatch. The work-level ## Calibration Log
     and ## Dispatches views are DERIVED unions of all per-task Dispatch Log sections.
     Source: `.claude/skills/aid-discover/SKILL.md ## Dispatch Protocol`. -->

| Date | Agent | ETA Band | Actual | Outcome |
|------|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| 2026-07-08 | aid-developer | ~8-20m | ~9m | Done -- Connectors stem added to both installer twins; +3 CONN cases (bash 44/44, PS 32/32); no render (lib is hand-authored) |
