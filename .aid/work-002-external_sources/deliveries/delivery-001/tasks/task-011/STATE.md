# Task State -- task-011

[!NOTE]
This is the TASK-LEVEL STATE.md template. All sections are AUTHORED by a single writer:
the delivery branch that owns this task. This file is the SOLE write target for all
per-task mutable state (state cell, review, elapsed, notes, findings, dispatch log).
The parent delivery-NNN/STATE.md ## Tasks State and work-level ## Tasks State are
DERIVED read-only views assembled from this file at read time -- never written directly.

> **Task:** task-011
> **Delivery:** delivery-001
> **Work:** work-002-external_sources

## Task State

<!-- AUTHORED -- written ONLY by `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --field State --value VALUE`.
     State enum (closed; single source of truth):
       Pending | In Progress | In Review | Blocked | Done | Failed | Canceled
     Ordering (most-advanced wins on reconcile):
       Done > Canceled > In Review > In Progress > Blocked > Failed > Pending -->

- **State:** Done
- **Review:** Pending
- **Elapsed:** ~10m
- **Notes:** --

## Quick Check Findings

<!-- AUTHORED -- written by `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --findings ...` during the
     per-task quick-check step of aid-execute. Records the reviewer tier used and all [HIGH]
     and [CRITICAL] findings for this task. [CRITICAL] findings trigger an immediate fix-on-spot;
     [HIGH] findings are deferred to the delivery gate via delivery-NNN-issues.md.
     No grade is recorded here -- grading is per-delivery, not per-task. -->

- **Reviewer Tier:** Small (orchestrator inline safety-net; graded review deferred to delivery gate)
- **Findings:** none. New `test-connector-secret-ac3-leak-sweep.sh` (11 assertions) adds the novel AC-3 sweep (grep repo/KB/STATE for a sentinel -> found only in the fixture `.secrets/` store) with a negative-control proving the sweep isn't vacuous; PS twin lane exercised (T6). Does NOT duplicate task-006's write/purge/confinement/fail-closed assertions (referenced). Orchestrator re-ran 11/11 and confirmed no sentinel residue (the one grep hit is the test's own prefix literal, not a leaked value; no fixture dir survives).

## Dispatch Log

<!-- AUTHORED -- appended by the dispatcher on subagent completion (L1+L2+L3 traceability;
     always-on, never optional). One row per dispatch. The work-level ## Calibration Log
     and ## Dispatches views are DERIVED unions of all per-task Dispatch Log sections.
     Source: `.claude/skills/aid-discover/SKILL.md ## Dispatch Protocol`. -->

| Date | Agent | ETA Band | Actual | Outcome |
|------|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| 2026-07-08 | aid-developer | ~5-15m | ~10m | Done -- AC-3 leak-sweep test (11 assertions + negative control); complements task-006 (no dup) |
