# Task State -- task-007

[!NOTE]
This is the TASK-LEVEL STATE.md template. All sections are AUTHORED by a single writer:
the delivery branch that owns this task. This file is the SOLE write target for all
per-task mutable state (state cell, review, elapsed, notes, findings, dispatch log).
The parent delivery-NNN/STATE.md ## Tasks State and work-level ## Tasks State are
DERIVED read-only views assembled from this file at read time -- never written directly.

> **Task:** task-007
> **Delivery:** delivery-001
> **Work:** work-002-external_sources

## Task State

<!-- AUTHORED -- written ONLY by `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --field State --value VALUE`.
     State enum (closed; single source of truth):
       Pending | In Progress | In Review | Blocked | Done | Failed | Canceled
     Ordering (most-advanced wins on reconcile):
       Done > Canceled > In Review > In Progress > Blocked > Failed > Pending -->

- **State:** Done
- **Review:** Pending
- **Elapsed:** ~8m
- **Notes:** --

## Quick Check Findings

<!-- AUTHORED -- written by `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --findings ...` during the
     per-task quick-check step of aid-execute. Records the reviewer tier used and all [HIGH]
     and [CRITICAL] findings for this task. [CRITICAL] findings trigger an immediate fix-on-spot;
     [HIGH] findings are deferred to the delivery gate via delivery-NNN-issues.md.
     No grade is recorded here -- grading is per-delivery, not per-task. -->

- **Reviewer Tier:** Small (orchestrator inline safety-net; graded review deferred to delivery gate)
- **Findings:** none. 8 seed rows authored, all connection_type/auth_method enum-valid; no secret/instance values. Executor flagged AC-5 (endpoint-template accuracy) PARTIAL for lack of network; orchestrator web-verified the flagship `github` row against github/github-mcp-server -> exact match (`docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`), so AC-5 -> PASS. Other rows use accurate documented REST API bases (conservative: no unverified MCP package names asserted).

## Dispatch Log

<!-- AUTHORED -- appended by the dispatcher on subagent completion (L1+L2+L3 traceability;
     always-on, never optional). One row per dispatch. The work-level ## Calibration Log
     and ## Dispatches views are DERIVED unions of all per-task Dispatch Log sections.
     Source: `.claude/skills/aid-discover/SKILL.md ## Dispatch Protocol`. -->

| Date | Agent | ETA Band | Actual | Outcome |
|------|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| 2026-07-08 | aid-developer | ~5-15m | ~8m | Done -- preset-catalog.md (8 rows); AC-5 github row web-verified by orchestrator; render deferred to d1 consolidation |
