# Task State -- task-005

[!NOTE]
This is the TASK-LEVEL STATE.md template. It is **full-path only** -- it lives at
`deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/STATE.md`. The `## Task State` mutable cell
(state/review/elapsed/notes) lives in the YAML frontmatter block above; the remaining
sections (Quick Check Findings, Dispatch Log) are AUTHORED as markdown body. All of it
is written by a single writer: the delivery branch that owns this task. This file is the
SOLE write target for all per-task mutable state (state cell, review, elapsed, notes,
findings, dispatch log). Its parent `deliveries/delivery-NNN/STATE.md ## Tasks State` and
the work-level `## Tasks State` are DERIVED read-only views assembled from this file at
read time -- never written directly.
Lite (flattened) path has **no per-task STATE.md at all**: each task's mutable cells
live directly in the work-root `STATE.md § ### Tasks lifecycle`, written via
`writeback-state.sh --task-id` targeting that table row instead of a sibling file.
`task-NNN`/`delivery-NNN`/`work-NNN-{name}` in the header blockquote below are INFERRED
from the folder path -- never authored in frontmatter.

Optional `ticket_ref` (frontmatter, full-path only): links this task to an external tracker item
(`<connector-stem>:<external-id>`, e.g. `jira:PROJ-123`). Left `--` when this task is not
independently linked; resolution then falls back to this task's owning (SPEC-traced) feature,
else its delivery, else the work (nearest-ancestor contract:
`.claude/aid/templates/connectors/consumption-protocol.md`). The flattened path (no per-task
STATE.md, `### Tasks lifecycle` above) carries no separate task-level `ticket_ref` of its own --
resolution for a flattened task passes straight through to its delivery/work levels, which do
carry the scalar (`work-state-template.md`'s frontmatter, both layouts). Coordinate with the
in-flight `work-003-state-schema` frontmatter conventions.

## Task State

<!-- AUTHORED -- values live in the YAML frontmatter block at the top of this file
     (`state`, `review`, `elapsed`, `notes`), written ONLY by
     `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --field State --value VALUE` (surgical frontmatter
     rewrite; the markdown body is never touched by that write).
     State enum (closed; single source of truth):
       Pending | In Progress | In Review | Blocked | Done | Failed | Canceled
     Ordering (most-advanced wins on reconcile):
       Done > Canceled > In Review > In Progress > Blocked > Failed > Pending

     MANDATORY (aid-execute/references/state-execute.md § State-Write Protocol):
     `state` MUST be written the INSTANT it changes -- In Progress before work
     starts, In Review before the reviewer is dispatched, a terminal value
     (Done/Failed) when finished. Binds whoever executes this task -- the
     main/orchestrator agent running it directly, or a dispatched sub-agent --
     with no exception either way. (Blocked is a distinct, orchestrator-
     assigned value for a different, downstream task that depends on a failed
     one -- never self-written by the task being executed.) -->

## Quick Check Findings

- **Reviewer Tier:** Small
- **Findings:** none

## Dispatch Log

<!-- AUTHORED -- appended by the dispatcher on subagent completion (L1+L2+L3 traceability;
     always-on, never optional). One row per dispatch. The work-level ## Calibration Log
     and ## Dispatches views are DERIVED unions of all per-task Dispatch Log sections.
     Source: `.claude/skills/aid-discover/SKILL.md ## Dispatch Protocol`. -->
