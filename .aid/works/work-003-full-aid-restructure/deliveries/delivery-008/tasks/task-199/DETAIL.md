# task-199: Dashboard readers: the single layout and lanes per delivery

> **Execution protocol (binding on whoever executes this task -- no
> exceptions):** the moment this task's `State` changes, write it --
> `In Progress` before starting work, `In Review` before dispatching the
> reviewer, and the terminal value (`Done` / `Failed`) at the end -- via
> `writeback-state.sh --field State --value ...`. This applies equally
> whether the main/orchestrator agent executes this task directly or
> dispatches it to a sub-agent; neither may skip, batch, or defer these
> writes. (`Blocked` is a distinct, orchestrator-assigned value for a
> DIFFERENT, downstream task that depends on a failed one -- it is never
> self-written by the task being executed.) Full mandate:
> `aid-execute/references/state-execute.md § MANDATORY: State-Write
> Protocol`.

**Type:** IMPLEMENT

**Source:** feature-006-planning -> delivery-008 -> AC-19, AC-41

**Depends on:** task-187

**Scope:**
- Both readers, kept equal by the parity tests (REQUIREMENTS.md § 11 Feature 006 `##### 5. Components`, Dashboard): `dashboard/reader/
  models.py`, `parsers.py`, `reader.py`, `derivation.py`, `state_schema.py` (its docstring example names
  `intent.depth`), and `dashboard/server/reader.mjs`:
  - tasks from `tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md` (title, type, delivery from Source, dependencies); task cells from
    `tasks_lifecycle`; delivery cells from `deliveries`; delivery names from the plan's `### delivery-NNN:`
    headings;
  - lanes derived per delivery from the task files (`_derive_lanes_from_details` and its Node twin, grouped by
    delivery);
  - work fields `depth` (from `intent.depth`) and `phases` (from `intent.phases`) are passed on.
- **Additive only (G12):** today's parses of the old layouts (`_detect_hierarchy`, `_read_work_hierarchical`,
  `_detect_flat`, `_declared_work_path`, `parse_task_state_md`, the delivery-file parse, the `wave-map` parse)
  still run in this task, so every existing fixture reads as before. task-188 then converts the writer and the
  suites that feed the readers through it, and task-200 removes the old parses and adds the old-layout diagnosis.
- New fixtures are task-211.
- Suites to update in this same task: the existing dashboard reader and parity suites, where a single-layout
  case is added beside the old ones, and any suite the findings' L6 assigns here.
- **Site regeneration (G1, G5).** When this task adds, deletes, renames or edits anything under
  `canonical/skills/`, `canonical/agents/` or `canonical/aid/templates/`, it runs
  `(cd site && npm run gen:skills && npm run gen:reference)` in this same task and commits the output:
  the skill pages, `skills/index.md`, `src/data/skill-flows/`, `reference/skills.md`,
  `reference/agents.md` and `scripts/.skills-manifest.json`.
  - It also updates any hard-coded count or name list in a site generator, for example the agent count
    in `site/scripts/gen-reference.mjs`, so the generators' drift checks pass at this task's end.
  - A generated site page is never edited by hand.
- **Later checks on this task's files (G3).** Before `Done`, run by hand, over the files this task
  writes, every static-check pattern that this delivery's own suites or an earlier delivery's suites apply
  to those files, and fix every hit here. Repo-wide criteria in this file are scoped to what this task
  owns.
- **Same-task rule (Q106).** This task updates every suite that asserts text in a file it changes,
  including `site/scripts/__tests__/` and the dashboard tests. It is not `Done` while such a suite fails.
  - A removed assertion gets its row in `tests/coverage-accepted-removals.tsv`.
  - A renamed assertion gets its row in `tests/coverage-rehome-allowlist.tsv`.
  - The baselines themselves are re-recorded at the gate (Q134, D11).
- **Findings.** This task's scope also includes every site that
  `.aid/works/work-003-full-aid-restructure/research/delivery-008-sites.md` assigns to `task-199`.
- **Test step** (PLAN.md § "Testing before the resync"; the same in every task of this delivery).
  `BASE` is this task's `task-199: In Progress` commit. Work in the `work-003` worktree only, create no
  branch or worktree, and never run `run_generator.py` in the live tree.
  1. **Spawn-free checks (T2).** Run `bash -n` on each changed `.sh`, `python3 -m py_compile` on each
     changed `.py`, and `node --check` on each changed `.mjs`.
  2. **Selection.** `SEL` is the output of `bash tests/canonical/select-suites.sh --since "$BASE"`.
     `COPY` is the members of `SEL` whose text matches the pattern `P` of PLAN.md § "Testing before the
     resync", The driver. `LIVE` is `SEL` minus `COPY`.
     - **Work-folder-only rule.** A task whose changes all lie under `.aid/works/` runs no suite: steps 2-5
       are skipped, and the report says so. The work folder is transient pipeline state that no suite may
       depend on, and it is not resync-relevant (PLAN.md § "Testing before the resync"). `select-suites.sh`
       is not the reason and is not run for it: it selects every suite with no `# COVERS:` header, whatever
       changed.
  3. **Scratch half** (when `COPY` is not empty).
     - Make the copy exactly as PLAN.md § "How the copy is made" says, with `S=.aid/.temp/scratch/task-199`.
       That includes the copy's own `run_generator.py`, run from inside it, then the `resync` commit.
     - Delete from `"$S"/tests/canonical/` every `test-*.sh` not in `COPY`.
     - Run `(cd "$S" && HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/run-all.sh)` and record its failures.
     - Run `rm -rf "$S"` before step 4.
     - If the copy's generator fails, that failure is the result, and `COPY` is reported as not run.
  4. **Live half.**
     - When `LIVE` is every suite outside `COPY`, run `HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/run-all.sh` and
       drop the `COPY` suites' results by name.
     - Otherwise, run each `LIVE` suite with `HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/canonical/<suite>`.
  5. **Outside `run-all.sh`.**
     - Run `(cd site && npm test)` when this task changes anything under `canonical/skills/`,
       `canonical/agents/` or `canonical/aid/templates/`, or under `docs/` or `site/` (G5). Run `npm ci`
       there first if `site/node_modules` is absent.
     - Run `python3 -m pytest <file>` for each dashboard Python test file this task changes, and
       `node --test <file>` for each dashboard `.mjs` test file it changes.
  6. **Report.** For each suite, report where it ran, its result and its run count.
     - Ceiling (T5): one full run of steps 2-5 per test round. Between rounds, re-run only the failing
       group (T6).
     - The same failure after three fix rounds goes to the maintainer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A scratch single-layout work with two deliveries reads with lanes per delivery and delivery names from the plan in both readers, identically, and every existing nested and flattened fixture still reads as before.
- [ ] The reader and parity suites pass where the test step puts them.
- [ ] The test step (last Scope bullet) reports no failure: the spawn-free checks, the scratch half, the live half and the site or dashboard runs it calls for. Every existing test still passes.
- [ ] All section-6 quality gates pass (REQUIREMENTS.md § 6: NFR-N, NFR-T, NFR-Q).
