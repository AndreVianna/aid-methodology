# task-156: Samples 004-05, 004-06, 004-08 and 004-09 (run at this gate), and 003-11's row

> **Execution protocol (binding on whoever executes this task -- no
> exceptions):** the moment this task's `State` changes, write it --
> `In Progress` before starting work, `In Review` before dispatching the
> reviewer, and the terminal value (`Done` / `Failed`) at the end -- via
> `writeback-state.sh --field State --value ...`. This applies equally
> whether the main/orchestrator agent executes this task directly or
> dispatches it to a sub-agent; neither may skip, batch, or defer these
> writes. (`Blocked` is a distinct, orchestrator-assigned value for a
> DIFFERENT, downstream task that depends on a failed one -- it is never
> self-written by the task being executed.) Full mandate:
> `aid-execute/references/state-execute.md § MANDATORY: State-Write
> Protocol`.

**Type:** TEST

**Source:** feature-004-kb-management -> delivery-006 -> AC-15, AC-28, AC-39, AC-43

**Depends on:** task-147, task-151

**Scope:**
- Create `004-05-drift-yes`, `004-06-drift-no`, `004-08-next-backlog-item` and `004-09-roadmap-idea-parked`
  under `tests/conversation/samples/feature-004/`, with their fixtures and the checks of REQUIREMENTS.md § 11 Feature 004
  `##### 8. Testing`.
- Update `tests/conversation/deferred.tsv`: the `003-11` row goes, since it runs at this gate (PLAN.md
  delivery-006 gate).
- Smoke run (Q134 D8): each new sample once, and `003-11` once, in a scratch copy.
- **Test step** (PLAN.md § "Testing before the resync"; the same in every task of this delivery).
  `BASE` is this task's `task-156: In Progress` commit. Work in the `work-003` worktree only, create no
  branch or worktree, and never run `run_generator.py` in the live tree.
  1. **Spawn-free checks (T2).** Run `bash -n` on each changed `.sh`, `python3 -m py_compile` on each
     changed `.py`, and `node --check` on each changed `.mjs`.
  2. **Selection.** `SEL` is the output of `bash tests/canonical/select-suites.sh --since "$BASE"`.
     `COPY` is the members of `SEL` whose text matches the pattern `P` of PLAN.md § "Testing before the
     resync", The driver. `LIVE` is `SEL` minus `COPY`. A change that lies wholly under `.aid/works/`
     selects nothing.
  3. **Scratch half** (when `COPY` is not empty).
     - Make the copy exactly as PLAN.md § "How the copy is made" says, with `S=.aid/.temp/scratch/task-156`.
       That includes the copy's own `run_generator.py`, run from inside it, then the `resync` commit.
     - Delete from `"$S"/tests/canonical/` every `test-*.sh` not in `COPY`.
     - Run `(cd "$S" && HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/run-all.sh)` and record its failures.
     - Run `rm -rf "$S"` before step 4.
     - If the copy's generator fails, that failure is the result, and `COPY` is reported as not run.
  4. **Live half.**
     - When `LIVE` is every suite outside `COPY`, run `HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/run-all.sh` and
       drop the `COPY` suites' results by name.
     - Otherwise, run each `LIVE` suite with `HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/canonical/<suite>`.
  5. **Outside `run-all.sh`.**
     - Run `(cd site && npm test)` when this task changes anything under `canonical/skills/`,
       `canonical/agents/` or `canonical/aid/templates/`, or under `docs/` or `site/` (G5). Run `npm ci`
       there first if `site/node_modules` is absent.
     - Run `python3 -m pytest <file>` for each dashboard Python test file this task changes, and
       `node --test <file>` for each dashboard `.mjs` test file it changes.
  6. **Report.** For each suite, report where it ran, its result and its run count.
     - Ceiling (T5): one full run of steps 2-5 per test round. Between rounds, re-run only the failing
       group (T6).
     - The same failure after three fix rounds goes to the maintainer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] There are four new files, and each `covers` matches the spec's sample table. No `## Answer sheet` names a skill.
- [ ] DT-01 and SS-09 pass, and `deferred.tsv` has no `003-11` row.
- [ ] Each smoke run has its result reported.
- [ ] The test step (last Scope bullet) reports no failure: the spawn-free checks, the scratch half, the live half and the site or dashboard runs it calls for. Every existing test still passes.
- [ ] All section-6 quality gates pass (REQUIREMENTS.md § 6: NFR-N, NFR-T, NFR-Q).
