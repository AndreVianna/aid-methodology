# task-108: Root package.json and the view's Playwright CI steps removed

> **Execution protocol (binding on whoever executes this task -- no
> exceptions):** the moment this task's `State` changes, write it --
> `In Progress` before starting work, `In Review` before dispatching the
> reviewer, and the terminal value (`Done` / `Failed`) at the end -- via
> `writeback-state.sh --field State --value ...`. This applies equally
> whether the main/orchestrator agent executes this task directly or
> dispatches it to a sub-agent; neither may skip, batch, or defer these
> writes. (`Blocked` is a distinct, orchestrator-assigned value for a
> DIFFERENT, downstream task that depends on a failed one -- it is never
> self-written by the task being executed.) Full mandate:
> `aid-execute/references/state-execute.md § MANDATORY: State-Write
> Protocol`.

**Type:** CONFIGURE

**Source:** feature-004-kb-management -> delivery-005 -> AC-15, AC-25

**Depends on:** task-104

**Scope:**
- Delete the repository-root `package.json`, and its entry in `.github/dependabot.yml`
  (REQUIREMENTS.md § 11 Feature 004 `##### 1. Files and layout`). Their only purpose was the view's Playwright check.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` and `release.yml`: the summarize validator steps and comments go.
- Suites to update in this same task: every workflow-reading suite the findings' K6 or K7 assigns here
  (`test-ascii-only.sh`, `test-ps51-compat.sh`, `test-aid-cli-parity.sh` where they apply).
- **KB `sources:` citations (G17).** Every `.aid/knowledge/` document whose frontmatter `sources:` cites a file or
  folder this task deletes, moves or renames is fixed in this same task (`git grep -n -e '<path>' -e '<folder>/' --
  .aid/knowledge/` at this task's base): the entry follows a moved file, and goes when the file is gone. Only the
  `sources:` entries change here; the prose stays for the delivery's DOCUMENT task. So `test-artifact-discipline.sh`
  AD14 (every `sources:` citation resolves) holds at this task's end. The KB lines are committed as the delivery
  commits KB paths (through `kb-commit.sh` once it exists, as Feature 007's BUILD requires).
- **Same-task rule (Q106).** This task updates every suite that asserts text in a file it changes,
  including `site/scripts/__tests__/` and the dashboard tests. It is not `Done` while such a suite fails.
  - A removed assertion gets its row in `tests/coverage-accepted-removals.tsv`.
  - A renamed assertion gets its row in `tests/coverage-rehome-allowlist.tsv`.
  - The baselines themselves are re-recorded at the gate (Q134, D11).
- **Findings.** This task's scope also includes every site that
  `.aid/works/work-003-full-aid-restructure/research/delivery-005-sites.md` assigns to `task-108`.
- **Test step** (PLAN.md § "Testing before the resync"; the same in every task of this delivery).
  `BASE` is this task's `task-108: In Progress` commit. Work in the `work-003` worktree only, create no
  branch or worktree, and never run `run_generator.py` in the live tree.
  1. **Spawn-free checks (T2).** Run `bash -n` on each changed `.sh`, `python3 -m py_compile` on each
     changed `.py`, and `node --check` on each changed `.mjs`.
  2. **Selection.** `SEL` is the output of `bash tests/canonical/select-suites.sh --since "$BASE"`.
     `COPY` is the members of `SEL` whose text matches the pattern `P` of PLAN.md § "Testing before the
     resync", The driver. `LIVE` is `SEL` minus `COPY`.
     - **Work-folder-only rule.** A task whose changes all lie under `.aid/works/` runs no suite: steps 2-5
       are skipped, and the report says so. The work folder is transient pipeline state that no suite may
       depend on, and it is not resync-relevant (PLAN.md § "Testing before the resync"). `select-suites.sh`
       is not the reason and is not run for it: it selects every suite with no `# COVERS:` header, whatever
       changed.
  3. **Scratch half** (when `COPY` is not empty).
     - Make the copy exactly as PLAN.md § "How the copy is made" says, with `S=.aid/.temp/scratch/task-108`.
       That includes the copy's own `run_generator.py`, run from inside it, then the `resync` commit.
     - Delete from `"$S"/tests/canonical/` every `test-*.sh` not in `COPY`.
     - Run `(cd "$S" && HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/run-all.sh)` and record its failures.
     - Run `rm -rf "$S"` before step 4.
     - If the copy's generator fails, that failure is the result, and `COPY` is reported as not run.
  4. **Live half.**
     - When `LIVE` is every suite outside `COPY`, run `HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/run-all.sh` and
       drop the `COPY` suites' results by name.
     - Otherwise, run each `LIVE` suite with `HOME="$(mktemp -d)" bash tests/canonical/<suite>`.
  5. **Outside `run-all.sh`.**
     - Run `(cd site && npm test)` when this task changes anything under `canonical/skills/`,
       `canonical/agents/` or `canonical/aid/templates/`, or under `docs/` or `site/` (G5). Run `npm ci`
       there first if `site/node_modules` is absent.
     - Run `python3 -m pytest <file>` for each dashboard Python test file this task changes, and
       `node --test <file>` for each dashboard `.mjs` test file it changes.
  6. **Report.** For each suite, report where it ran, its result and its run count.
     - Ceiling (T5): one full run of steps 2-5 per test round. Between rounds, re-run only the failing
       group (T6).
     - The same failure after three fix rounds goes to the maintainer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `test -e package.json` fails; `grep -c` for `package.json` or `npm` in the root `package-ecosystem` entry of `.github/dependabot.yml` finds no root entry; `grep -c summarize .github/workflows/test.yml .github/workflows/release.yml` totals 0.
- [ ] The workflow-reading suites pass. No secret is added, and applying the edit twice changes nothing.
- [ ] Over `.aid/knowledge/`, no frontmatter `sources:` entry cites a path this task deletes, moves or renames, and `test-artifact-discipline.sh` AD14 passes where the test step puts the suite (G17).
- [ ] The test step (last Scope bullet) reports no failure: the spawn-free checks, the scratch half, the live half and the site or dashboard runs it calls for. Every existing test still passes.
- [ ] All section-6 quality gates pass (REQUIREMENTS.md § 6: NFR-N, NFR-T, NFR-Q).
