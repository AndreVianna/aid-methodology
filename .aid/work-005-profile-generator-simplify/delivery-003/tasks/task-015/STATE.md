# Task State -- task-015

[!NOTE]
This is the TASK-LEVEL STATE.md template. All sections are AUTHORED by a single writer:
the delivery branch that owns this task. This file is the SOLE write target for all
per-task mutable state (state cell, review, elapsed, notes, findings, dispatch log).
The parent delivery-NNN/STATE.md ## Tasks State and work-level ## Tasks State are
DERIVED read-only views assembled from this file at read time -- never written directly.

## Task State

<!-- AUTHORED -- written ONLY by `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --field State --value VALUE`.
     State enum (closed; single source of truth):
       Pending | In Progress | In Review | Blocked | Done | Failed | Canceled
     Enum values are byte-identical to the legacy work-state-template.md set.
     SD-2 ordering (most-advanced wins on reconcile):
       Done > Canceled > In Review > In Progress > Blocked > Failed > Pending -->

- **State:** Done
- **Review:** PASS — Small-tier quick-check, 0 CRITICAL/HIGH. Independent class-wide grep: 0 live retired refs (30+ -> 0). sync-docs idempotent (proven 2 ways). Accuracy verified vs real profiles/* trees (codex/cursor/antigravity/copilot). MDX well-formed. Scope clean (no KB/code/test). 1 non-blocking MINOR (stale templates/scripts/grade.sh support-path in cursor README) -> gate.
- **Elapsed:** ~00:05
- **Notes:** docs/{install,faq,repository-structure,glossary,aid-methodology}.md + CONTRIBUTING.md + profiles/{cursor,codex}/README.md + site installation.mdx/cli.mdx hand-edits + 4 sync-regenerated site pages. Formats four->two; codex unified; rules sections removed.

## Quick Check Findings

<!-- AUTHORED -- written by `writeback-state.sh --task-id NNN --findings ...` during the
     per-task quick-check step of aid-execute. Records the reviewer tier used and all [HIGH]
     and [CRITICAL] findings for this task. [CRITICAL] findings trigger an immediate fix-on-spot;
     [HIGH] findings are deferred to the delivery gate via delivery-NNN-issues.md.
     No grade is recorded here -- grading is per-delivery, not per-task. -->

- **Reviewer Tier:** Small (quick check always uses Small tier)
- **Findings:**

## Dispatch Log

<!-- AUTHORED -- appended by the dispatcher on subagent completion (L1+L2+L3 traceability;
     always-on, never optional). One row per dispatch. The work-level ## Calibration Log
     and ## Dispatches views are DERIVED unions of all per-task Dispatch Log sections.
     Source: `.claude/skills/aid-discover/SKILL.md ## Dispatch Protocol`. -->
