# Route to the Right Entry

For the "I don't know which path or skill fits" case. Takes a short free-form
description and suggests where to go next -- a specific direct-entry shortcut
(`/aid-fix`, `/aid-create-api`, ...) for a known, single change, or the full
path (`/aid-describe`) for anything broad, multi-activity, or ambiguous.

This skill is largely the **extraction** of `/aid-describe`'s former TRIAGE
routing logic into a standalone router, so the routing capability
`/aid-describe` used to provide is preserved here, relocated (see
`references/state-suggest.md` for the reflect-back turn this was extracted
from).

## Agents Involved

`/aid-triage` is a **single-turn, suggest-only** skill -- it runs entirely
inline, with no subagent dispatch. NFR-8 (no over-engineering): the
reflect-back turn is a one-shot conversational exchange, not a multi-turn
interview, so no dedicated agent, work folder, or `STATE.md` is warranted.
Because the skill produces no graded artifact (it writes nothing to disk),
there is no runtime `aid-reviewer` gate either -- unlike the retired
aid-describe lite-path review step, FR-11's per-document grading does not apply here. The skill
itself is graded at build time by `aid-reviewer` like any other shipped
skill.

## Pre-flight

Check that a free-form description was supplied (as the invocation argument,
or -- if omitted -- ask for it in the INTAKE turn below; either is fine, the
description is always captured before CLASSIFY runs).

No `.aid/` workspace check is required -- `/aid-triage` never reads or writes
work state; it only reads the installed catalog.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `[description]` | A short free-form description of what you want to do. If omitted, INTAKE asks for it. |

---

## State Machine

`/aid-triage` is **stateless across invocations** -- there is no `STATE.md`,
no work folder, and therefore no state to resume. Every invocation starts
fresh at INTAKE and runs straight through to HALT in one pass.

```
[● INTAKE ] -> [ CLASSIFY ] -> [ SUGGEST ] -> [ HALT ]
```

> **State-machine chaining:** Each `/aid-triage` invocation drives the state
> machine until it hits a natural pause point per
> `canonical/aid/templates/state-machine-chaining.md`. Every state here is
> either mechanical or an inline question; only HALT stops the run.

## Dispatch

| State | Detail | Worker | Advance |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| INTAKE | inline (below) | inline | CHAIN -> CLASSIFY |
| CLASSIFY | `references/state-classify.md` | inline | CHAIN -> SUGGEST |
| SUGGEST | `references/state-suggest.md` | inline | CHAIN -> HALT |
| HALT | inline (below) | inline | -> halt |

## State: INTAKE

Capture one short free-form description in a single turn -- no adaptive
loop, no scaffold. If the invocation already carried a `[description]`
argument, use it directly and skip the prompt below.

```
In a sentence or two -- what do you want to build, change, or fix?

Suggested: For example: "fix the login crash on special characters" or
           "add a /orders REST endpoint."
Why: A short description is enough to tell whether this is a single,
     well-scoped change (I can point you straight at a shortcut) or
     something broader (better handled by the full /aid-describe interview).

[1] Use the form above and share yours
[2] Your answer: ___
```

Wait for the answer. Record it internally as `{description}`.

**Advance:** **CHAIN** -> [State: CLASSIFY] (continue inline).

---

## State: HALT

Print the recommended invocation the user should type next, then **STOP**.
`/aid-triage` never invokes another skill on the user's behalf -- it
suggests; the user runs the command. No file is written; no `.aid/works/work-*/`
folder is created; no `STATE.md` exists for this skill.

**Shortcut suggested:**
```
-> Suggested next step:

    /{name} "{description}"

Run that command to start -- it goes straight to the flattened Lite work
for {intent}.
```

**Full path suggested:**
```
-> Suggested next step:

    /aid-describe

Run that command to start the full requirements interview.
```

## Constraints

- **Suggest-only (FR-13).** No interview, no scaffold, no work folder, no
  `STATE.md` is ever created by this skill.
- **Write-free.** `allowed-tools` is `Read, Glob, Grep` only -- no `Write`,
  no `Edit`. This skill cannot write anything even if instructed to.
- **Canonical names only (Step 3 catalog match).** When the suggestion comes
  from Step 3's shortcut-catalog semantic match (Cases A/B/C), it is always a
  canonical catalog `name` (`alias_of: null`); an alias row is never
  suggested directly there -- see `references/state-classify.md`.
  **Intended exception: Case D (the QUESTION route)** suggests `/aid-ask`
  directly -- Step 0 short-circuits past Step 3 entirely for a question, and
  `aid-ask` is a `repurpose: true` hand-authored Q&A entry point (its
  canonical form `/aid-query-kb` is an equivalent hand-authored skill, not a
  thin doorway `build-shortcut-skills.py` generates), so there is no
  doorway-duplication concern -- see `references/state-suggest.md` Case D.
- **Conservative default.** Anything short of one confident, single-match
  suggestion routes to the full path (`/aid-describe`) -- mirrors the
  conservative default that aid-describe's former TRIAGE state used before
  extraction.
