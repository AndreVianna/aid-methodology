# Dispatch Protocol Checklist

> **Source:** work-003 subagent-visibility-patch (L1+L2+L3 traceability).
> Every AID skill that dispatches subagents follows this checklist.

Every subagent dispatch in this skill MUST follow this protocol so the user
sees mid-wait progress instead of going silent for 10–25+ minutes. The full
protocol lives in two reference docs; this section is a checklist citing them.

**Before each dispatch:**

1. **Look up ETA** in `.cursor/templates/rough-time-hints.md` for the
   subagent's operation class. Capture LOW–HIGH band.
2. **Read heartbeat config** via
   `bash .cursor/scripts/config/read-setting.sh --path traceability.heartbeat_interval --default 1`
   (resolves from `.aid/settings.yml`; default 1; `0` = disabled).
3. **Pre-create heartbeat file** (always — unconditional, per work-003 traceability):
   - Pre-create `.aid/.heartbeat/<agent-name>-<unix-ts>.txt`
   - Include `HEARTBEAT_FILE=<path>` + `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=Nm` in dispatch prompt
4. **Arm 3 L2 timers** (via `run_in_background: true`):
   - `sleep <LOW/2 in s> && echo "... <agent> still running (Xm elapsed of ~LOW–HIGH)"`
   - `sleep <LOW in s> && echo "... <agent> at estimated time (LOWm elapsed)"`
   - `sleep <1.5×LOW in s> && echo "⚠️ <agent> EXCEEDED estimate (1.5×LOWm elapsed); consider checking on it or cancelling"`

**During dispatch:**

- **On L2 timer fire:** surface the timer output. If heartbeat file exists,
  also read it and append `[from heartbeat] state: <state> · progress: <progress>
  · activity: <activity>` to the narration.

**On completion / failure:**

- **Success:** emit `✓ <agent> done in <actual>` with measured time. Log to
  `STATE.md ## Calibration Log` for L1 calibration. Delete heartbeat file.
- **Failure:** emit `✗ <agent> FAILED after <elapsed> (reason: <one-line>)`.
  Decide whether to re-dispatch, fall back, or surface to user. Delete
  heartbeat file.

**References:**

- `.cursor/templates/long-wait-protocol.md` — full L2 spec
- `.cursor/templates/subagent-heartbeat-protocol.md` — full L3 spec
- `.cursor/templates/rough-time-hints.md` — current measured ETAs
- `.cursor/agents/*/AGENT.md ## Heartbeat protocol` — subagent-side contract

The existing `▶ <agent> starting (~<ETA>)` and `✓ <agent> done` bracket-pair
lines elsewhere in this skill body remain in place; this protocol just makes
them more informative by adding mid-wait check-ins + structured progress.
