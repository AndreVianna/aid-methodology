description: >
  Decompose approved requirements into discrete features, each recorded as a
  `### Feature NNN` section of REQUIREMENTS.md § 11 that cites the `AC-N` criteria it
  claims. Use this skill once `/aid-describe` has produced an approved REQUIREMENTS.md
  and the work needs splitting into features before any one of them is specified. It
  turns each functional requirement into a feature, then validates the requirements and
  the feature boundaries against the Knowledge Base and the codebase, and halts ready
  for `/aid-specify`.

# Feature Definition from Approved Requirements

## Agents Involved

aid-define is **multi-agent** — different states use different agents.

| State | Phase | Agent | Why |
|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| 5 FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION | Feature Decomposition | `aid-architect` | Design work — breaking requirements into structured features |
| 6 CROSS-REFERENCE | Cross-Reference & Refine | `aid-reviewer` | Adversarial validation against KB and codebase |
| 7 DONE | DONE | (no dispatch) | Terminal state, user choice prompt |

Decompose approved `REQUIREMENTS.md` into `### Feature NNN` sections under § 11, then
cross-reference the
result against the Knowledge Base and codebase. Produces `REQUIREMENTS.md §11` feature sections
ready for `/aid-specify`.

**Precondition:** `## Interview State: Approved` must be present in `.aid/works/{work}/STATE.md`.
If requirements are not yet approved, run `/aid-describe {work}` first to gather and
approve requirements.

**Workspace structure:**
```
.aid/
  knowledge/           <- shared KB (populated by /aid-discover)
  work-001-name/
    STATE.md           <- process (Interview State: Approved, Cross-Reference, Features State)
    REQUIREMENTS.md    <- approved requirements (/aid-describe) + §11 Features
                          (this skill) + each feature's Technical Specification
                          (/aid-specify). Features are sections; they have no
                          folders and no files of their own.
```

> **Accuracy note.** `interview.state`/`interview.grade`/`interview.sections[]` are real
> keys in `work-state-template.yml`, and so is **`features[]`** -- this skill creates one
> entry there per `### Feature NNN` section it appends to `REQUIREMENTS.md § 11`, and
> `/aid-specify` updates it as each feature advances. Features State was previously
> described here as "a DERIVED view with no key at all"; that was wrong, and it was not a
> harmless wrong -- the `STATE.md` -> `STATE.yml` converter believed it and refused to
> convert any work that had reached this phase. A per-feature "Cross-Reference" status and a
> Q&A-adjacent "Review History" list, as used below, do still carry no dedicated key -- they
> describe this skill's aspirational tracking design rather than a writable structure, and
> that remains an open schema gap. The **Review History** list now has a real target of its own,
> the `review_history` sequence, and Cross-phase Q&A entries have the `qa` sequence.

**First run (after approval):** Decompose functional requirements into `REQUIREMENTS.md`
§11 feature sections.
**After cross-reference:** DONE — ready for `/aid-specify`.
**Re-run decomposition:** pass `--features {work}` to re-run even if features exist.

## ⚠️ Pre-flight Checks

### Check 1: Verify Workspace Exists

Check if `.aid/` directory exists. If it doesn't:
```
⚠️ AID workspace not found. Run /aid-config first to set up the project.
```
Exit. Do not proceed.

### Check 2: Verify Not in Plan Mode

- ✅ `Default` or `Auto-accept edits` → Proceed.
- ❌ `Plan mode` → **STOP.** Tell the user to switch out of Plan Mode.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `work-NNN` | Work on the specified work item. |
| `--features work-NNN` | Re-run feature decomposition for this work even if features exist. |
| *(no argument)* | Select from existing approved works (see Task Routing). |

## Task Routing

When no work ID is provided, resolve the `Approved` candidate set in two layers — a
cross-worktree candidate set (the same source the other downstream skills use), refined
by an `interview.state: Approved` sub-filter this skill alone needs, because the
enumerate record carries no Interview-State field.

### Layer 1 — cross-worktree candidate set

Enumerate works **cross-worktree**: run
`bash .agent/aid/scripts/works/enumerate-works.sh` (main tree + every git worktree;
never the local `.aid/works/` glob, which is empty on `master`), taking each record's
field-1 `work_id` and field-4 `branch_label`.

**Zero records on any worktree** → **STOP.**
```
No approved works found. Run /aid-describe first to gather and approve requirements.
```
Exit.

### Layer 2 — per-candidate `Approved` sub-filter (read-only `git show`)

For each `(work_id, branch_label)` candidate from Layer 1, determine `Approved` without
entering any worktree:

- **`branch_label` is the literal `(detached)`** (a detached-HEAD worktree — not a
  resolvable git ref): **skip** the `git show` check for this candidate and **retain**
  it in the menu rather than drop it. Its `Approved` status is deferred to the
  authoritative post-enter `## State Detection` step 2 below, which HALTs if the
  entered work turns out not to be `Approved`. Never pass a `(detached)` label to
  `git show`.
- **Otherwise**, run a read-only `git show "<branch_label>:.aid/works/<work_id>/STATE.md"`
  and check whether its `## Interview State` section shows `Approved`:
  - **Shows `Approved`** → retain the candidate.
  - **Does not show `Approved`** (including "file not found at that ref") → drop the
    candidate from the menu.
- **De-duplicate** by `work_id` when the same work appears on more than one
  `branch_label`.

This `git show` reads the **committed** view only — best-effort, and it can skew in
either direction against a live worktree's uncommitted `STATE.md`:
- **False positive** (committed shows `Approved`, a live worktree has since regressed
  it): the candidate is retained here; `## State Detection` step 2 (post-enter, over the
  live file) HALTs on the non-`Approved` value — fail-closed, this can never route into
  a non-Approved work.
- **False negative** (a live worktree holds `Approved` **uncommitted**, the committed
  tip still shows pre-`Approved`): this pre-filter cannot see it, so the work is
  silently absent from the auto-generated menu below — a menu-completeness gap, not a
  correctness defect. **Documented fallback:** invoke `/aid-define work-NNN` directly.
  The argument path bypasses Task Routing (and this filter) entirely — see "Locate +
  Enter the Work's Worktree" below — so `## State Detection` step 2 confirms `Approved`
  from the live, entered `STATE.md`.

### No candidates survive Layer 2

```
No approved works found. Run /aid-describe first to gather and approve requirements.
```

Exit.

### One or more candidates survive Layer 2

```
Approved works ready for feature definition:
  work-001-user-auth   [3 features, cross-reference pending]
  work-002-reporting   [no features yet]

[1] Continue work-001-user-auth
[2] Continue work-002-reporting
```

Wait for response and proceed to State Detection for that work.

**Shortcut:** If only one candidate survives Layer 2, go directly to it without asking.

## Locate + Enter the Work's Worktree

**As soon as `<work-id>` is known** — from the `work-NNN` argument, or from Task Routing above —
and **before** State Detection reads `.aid/works/{work}/STATE.md`, follow
`.agent/aid/templates/downstream-worktree-entry.md` to normalize `<work-id>` to its bare
`work-NNN` branch name, `locate` the worktree (which **always exits 0** and returns
`<path>\t<status>`), and enter the returned path. Keep the defensive empty-path/non-zero backstop
that stops rather than operate blindly — it should not fire against the real helper. Never create
a new worktree — creation belongs to the work-starting skills only.

---

## State Detection

⚠️ **FILESYSTEM IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF TRUTH.**
Do NOT rely on memory from previous runs. ALWAYS read the actual files on disk.

All paths below are relative to `.aid/works/{work}/`.

```plaintext
Precondition: Interview State: Approved in STATE.md -- HALT if not met (see below)
State 5:  **Path:** full, Interview State: Approved,
          no § 11 feature sections                                 -> FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION
State 6:  **Path:** full, Interview State: Approved, features exist,
          cross-reference not yet done                             -> CROSS-REFERENCE
State 7:  **Path:** full, Interview State: Approved, features +
          cross-ref already complete                               -> DONE
```

**Detection logic:**

1. Read `STATE.md` `## Interview State` `**Interview State:**` field.
2. If field is absent or value is NOT `Approved`:
   - Print: `[aid-define] Requirements for {work} are not yet approved. Run /aid-describe {work} first to gather and approve requirements.`
   - HALT
3. If State is `Approved`:
   - If `--features` flag provided → **State 5: FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION**
   - Check if `REQUIREMENTS.md § 11 Features` exists and contains `### Feature NNN` subsections
   - If no feature sections → **State 5: FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION**
   - If feature sections exist:
     - Check STATE.md `## Interview State` `## Cross-Reference` sub-section for `**State:** Complete`
       (or check if cross-reference entries exist from a prior run)
     - If cross-reference not yet done → **State 6: CROSS-REFERENCE**
     - If cross-reference already complete → **State 7: DONE**

Print the state-entry line and "you are here" map. Examples for each state:

**FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION:**
```
[State: FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION] — Decompose approved requirements into § 11 feature sections.
aid-define  ▸ you are here
  (from /aid-describe: COMPLETION -> approved REQUIREMENTS)
  [● FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION ] → [ CROSS-REFERENCE ] → [ DONE ] → [ /aid-specify ]
```

**CROSS-REFERENCE:**
```
[State: CROSS-REFERENCE] — Validate REQUIREMENTS.md against KB and codebase; create Q&A for gaps.
aid-define  ▸ you are here
  [✓ FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION ] → [● CROSS-REFERENCE ] → [ DONE ] → [ /aid-specify ]
```

**DONE:**
```
[State: DONE] — Interview complete, approved, decomposed, and cross-referenced.
aid-define  ▸ you are here
  [✓ FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION ] → [✓ CROSS-REFERENCE ] → [● DONE ] → [ /aid-specify ]
```

## Dispatch

| State | Detail | Worker | Advance |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| FEATURE-DECOMPOSITION | `references/state-feature-decomposition.md` | `aid-architect` | → CROSS-REFERENCE |
| CROSS-REFERENCE | `references/state-cross-reference.md` | `aid-reviewer` | → DONE |
| DONE | `references/state-done.md` | `inline` | → halt |

On state entry, print `[State: NAME]` + the "you are here" map from State Detection above.
When a state completes, route by its `**Advance:**` type (per [`state-machine-chaining.md`](../../aid/templates/state-machine-chaining.md)):
- **CHAIN** → begin the next state's reference doc within the same invocation; no exit.
- **HALT** → print the closing summary and exit.
