# Package & Ship

Package completed deliveries into a release.

## Agents Involved

- **Default executor:** `aid-operator` (orchestrates the release: verifies build, packages artifacts, updates statuses).
- **Specialist consults (optional):** `aid-tech-writer` for release notes / changelog, `aid-operator` if CI/CD configuration changes are needed during release, `aid-reviewer` for final pre-release verification.

## Argument-Hint

```
/aid-deploy work-NNN
/aid-deploy "<free-form description of what to ship>"
```

**Two invocation modes** (invocation-context detection; see `## ⚠️ Pre-flight Checks`
Step 0):

- **`work-NNN` present** -- the existing pipeline path below runs unchanged
  (`IDLE -> SELECTING -> VERIFYING -> PACKAGING -> DONE`, post-Execute). Required: work
  ID. If only one work exists, auto-select it.
- **No `work-NNN`, a free-form description instead** -- the Lite-path direct-entry
  shortcut: binds `{name}=aid-deploy`, `{verb}=deploy`, `{artifact}=""` (bare verb),
  `{description}=<the given text>`, then delegates to the shared shortcut engine
  (`.github/aid/templates/shortcut-engine.md`, `INTAKE -> ... -> APPROVAL-HALT`),
  scaffolding a flattened Lite work and running the grading gates. **Never executes** --
  it halts for approval; this shortcut entry does not replace the pipeline role below,
  it adds a second, independent entry point to the same skill directory.

## Workspace

```
.aid/
  knowledge/
    STATE.md                   ← Q&A, Review History (settings → .aid/settings.yml), Q&A (Pending)
.aid/works/{work}/
  STATE.md                     ← § Deploy State (current operation status, history)
  packages/                    ← product (one file per release)
    package-001-{name}.md
    package-002-{name}.md
  PLAN.md                      ← deliveries and sequencing
  deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/  ← full path: task files with statuses
  tasks/task-NNN/                          ← lite path: task files with statuses (no delivery-NNN/ nesting)
  features/                    ← feature SPECs
```

## ⚠️ Pre-flight Checks

### Step 0: Invocation-context mode detection

- **`work-NNN` argument present** → proceed with Steps 1–6 below (the existing
  pipeline path; untouched).
- **No `work-NNN` argument, but a free-form description was given instead** → the
  shortcut-scaffold path (see `## Argument-Hint` above): bind `{name}=aid-deploy`,
  `{verb}=deploy`, `{artifact}=""`, `{description}=<the given text>`, then delegate
  directly to `.github/aid/templates/shortcut-engine.md § State: INTAKE` — Steps 1–6
  below do not run for this path (that pre-flight belongs to the post-Execute pipeline
  role, not the shortcut entry).
- **Neither `work-NNN` nor a description** → print the `## Argument-Hint` usage block
  and exit.

1. Verify `.aid/` workspace exists.
2. Resolve work directory: if the `work-NNN` argument was given, use that work
   directory; if not (single-work auto-select), enumerate works **cross-worktree**:
   run `bash .github/aid/scripts/works/enumerate-works.sh` (main tree + every git
   worktree; never the local `.aid/works/` glob, which is empty on `master`), taking
   each record's field-1 `work_id` — single record → auto-select; multiple records →
   list them, ask user to choose; zero records on any worktree → **STOP.** "No works
   found. Run `/aid-describe` first." **Then locate + enter the work's
   worktree**, before item 3 below reads work `STATE.md`: follow
   `.github/aid/templates/downstream-worktree-entry.md` to normalize the work id to its bare
   `work-NNN` branch name, `locate` the worktree (which **always exits 0** and returns
   `<path>\t<status>`), and enter the returned path. Keep the defensive empty-path/non-zero
   backstop that stops rather than operate blindly — it should not fire against the real helper.
   Never create a new worktree — creation belongs to the work-starting skills only. (Applies only
   to this `work-NNN` pipeline path — the free-form shortcut mode in Step 0 does not reach here.)
3. Read work `STATE.md` `## Deploy State` section (or create it if absent).
4. Read `PLAN.md` — identify deliveries and their statuses.
5. Check work `STATE.md` `## Tasks State` — check statuses and grades.
6. If Deploy State shows an active package → resume from that step (see State Detection).

## State Detection

Read work `STATE.md` `## Deploy State`:
- **Status: Idle** → IDLE state (start new package; see `references/state-idle.md`)
- **Status: Selecting** → SELECTING state (resume delivery selection; see `references/state-selecting.md`)
- **Status: Verifying** → VERIFYING state (resume verification; see `references/state-verifying.md`)
- **Status: Packaging** → PACKAGING state (resume packaging; see `references/state-packaging.md`)
- **Status: Done** → Re-run mode (see Re-run section)

Print the state-entry line and "you are here" map:

**IDLE / first run:**
```
[State: IDLE] — No active release; begin assessing eligible deliveries.
aid-deploy  ▸ you are here
  [● IDLE ] → [ SELECTING ] → [ VERIFYING ] → [ PACKAGING ] → [ DONE ]
```

**SELECTING:**
```
[State: SELECTING] — Presenting eligible deliveries for user to include in this release.
aid-deploy  ▸ you are here
  [✓ IDLE ] → [● SELECTING ] → [ VERIFYING ] → [ PACKAGING ] → [ DONE ]
```

**VERIFYING:**
```
[State: VERIFYING] — Running full build, tests, and lint against selected deliveries.
aid-deploy  ▸ you are here
  [✓ IDLE ] → [✓ SELECTING ] → [● VERIFYING ] → [ PACKAGING ] → [ DONE ]
```

**PACKAGING:**
```
[State: PACKAGING] — Producing release artifacts per infrastructure.md § Deployment.
aid-deploy  ▸ you are here
  [✓ IDLE ] → [✓ SELECTING ] → [✓ VERIFYING ] → [● PACKAGING ] → [ DONE ]
```

**DONE:**
```
[State: DONE] — Release complete; all deliveries and tasks marked Shipped.
aid-deploy  ▸ you are here
  [✓ IDLE ] → [✓ SELECTING ] → [✓ VERIFYING ] → [✓ PACKAGING ] → [● DONE ]
```

## Inputs

- `.aid/works/{work}/PLAN.md` — deliveries, sequencing, success criteria
- Per-task `DETAIL.md` — task scope; full path: `.aid/works/{work}/deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md`; lite path: `.aid/works/{work}/tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md`
- `.aid/works/{work}/features/*/SPEC.md` — what was specified
- Work `STATE.md` `## Tasks State` table — task statuses and review grades per task (both paths derive into this same rollup)
- `known-issues.md` — if exists, check for Critical/High blockers
- **KB via INDEX.md** — Read `.aid/knowledge/INDEX.md`, pull:
  - `infrastructure.md` § Deployment — how to package, where to publish
  - `infrastructure.md` § Source Control — VCS commands, branching strategy
  - `technology-stack.md` § Commands — build, lint, test commands
  - Any other docs INDEX summaries indicate are relevant

## Dispatch Protocol

This skill follows the L1+L2+L3 subagent-visibility protocol (work-003 traceability —
heartbeats, ETA timers, calibration). The full checklist lives in
`.github/aid/templates/dispatch-protocol-checklist.md`; read it before any subagent
dispatch in this skill.

## Dispatch

| State | Detail | Worker | Advance |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| IDLE | `references/state-idle.md` | `aid-operator` | → SELECTING |
| SELECTING | `references/state-selecting.md` | `aid-operator` | → VERIFYING |
| VERIFYING | `references/state-verifying.md` | `aid-operator` | → PACKAGING |
| PACKAGING | `references/state-packaging.md` | `aid-operator` | → DONE |
| DONE | `references/state-done.md` | `inline` | → halt |
| RE-RUN | `references/state-re-run.md` | `inline` | → halt |

On state entry, print `[State: NAME]` + the "you are here" map from State Detection above.
When a state completes, route by its `**Advance:**` type (per [`state-machine-chaining.md`](../../templates/state-machine-chaining.md)):
- **CHAIN** → begin the next state's reference doc within the same invocation; no exit.
- **PAUSE-FOR-USER-ACTION** / **PAUSE-FOR-USER-DECISION** → print the pause reason + resume command and exit.
- **HALT** → print the closing summary and exit.
