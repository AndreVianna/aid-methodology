# Execute Task

Read the type. Do the work. Review it. Fix it. Ship it.

## ⚠️⚠️ MANDATORY: write task State AS IT CHANGES -- read this first

> **Whoever executes this task -- the main/orchestrator agent running it
> DIRECTLY, or a dispatched sub-agent -- MUST write the task's `State` field
> the instant it changes: `In Progress` before starting work, `In Review`
> before dispatching the reviewer, and a terminal value (`Done` / `Failed`)
> when finished. No agent may skip, batch, or defer these writes, on the
> flat OR full layout, whether this task is run alone or as part of a pool
> dispatch.** The full mandate, the exact command for each transition, and the
> why lives in `references/state-execute.md § MANDATORY: State-Write
> Protocol` -- read it before Step 1 below. Skipping these writes is the
> single most common root cause of a task that shows `Pending` in the
> dashboard for its entire execution and then jumps straight to `Done`.

## ⚠️ Pre-flight Checks

### Check 1: Locate Work and Task

1. Read first arg: if it starts with `work-` → use that work directory; if it starts with `task-` → treat as shorthand (single-work auto-select below)
2. If work arg not provided (or shorthand): enumerate works **cross-worktree**: run
   `bash .github/aid/scripts/works/enumerate-works.sh` (main tree + every git
   worktree; never the local `.aid/works/` glob, which is empty on `master`), taking
   each record's field-1 `work_id` — single record → auto-select; multiple records →
   list them, ask user to choose; zero records on any worktree → **STOP.** "No works
   found. Run `/aid-describe` first."
3. Read second arg (or first arg when shorthand): the `task-NNN` identifier; also resolve `delivery-NNN` from the task identifier or from the Source field

   **Locate + enter the work's worktree.** Now that the work id is resolved (steps 1-3 above) and
   **before** step 4 below reads anything under `.aid/works/{work}/…`, follow
   `.github/aid/templates/downstream-worktree-entry.md` to normalize the work id to its bare
   `work-NNN` branch name, `locate` the worktree (which **always exits 0** and returns
   `<path>\t<status>`), and enter the returned path. Keep the defensive empty-path/non-zero
   backstop that stops rather than operate blindly — it should not fire against the real helper.
   Never create a new worktree — creation belongs to the work-starting skills only.
4. **Detect the layout** (per-work, presence-based; additive — does not change the full-path resolution below):
   - **Full path (nested):** `.aid/works/{work}/deliveries/` exists → tasks live at `deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md`.
   - **Flat path (feature-001, single-delivery):** a work-root `BLUEPRINT.md` present AND `.aid/works/{work}/tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md` exists directly under the work root AND no `deliveries/` wrapper under it → the delivery is always the synthesized `delivery-001` (no per-task `STATE.md`; task mutable cells live in the work-root `STATE.md § ### Tasks lifecycle` instead — see `## Workspace` below).
5. Find the task definition at the layout-appropriate path from step 4.
6. Task not found → **STOP.** List available tasks.

### Check 2: Read Task

Read the task definition from:
- **Full path:** `.aid/works/{work}/deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md`
- **Flat path:** `.aid/works/{work}/tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md`

It has 6 sections:
- **Title** — what this task does
- **Type** — RESEARCH | DESIGN | IMPLEMENT | TEST | DOCUMENT | MIGRATE | REFACTOR | CONFIGURE
- **Source** — `work-NNN-{name} → delivery-NNN` (which work and delivery)
- **Depends on** — which tasks must be complete before this one (or `—` for none)
- **Scope** — what to produce or modify (files, tests, docs, configs — depends on type)
- **Acceptance Criteria** — concrete, testable conditions

### Check 2b: Verify Dependencies Met

Read the Execution Graph:
- **Full path:** from PLAN.md's `#### Execution Graph` block for this task's delivery.
- **Flat path:** from the work-root `PLAN.md`'s top-level `## Execution Graph` (see
  `references/state-execute.md § Locate the Execution Graph`).

Check that all tasks listed in `Depends on:` have `State: Done`:
- **Full path:** in their respective `deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/STATE.md`
  files (the `## Task State` section).
- **Flat path:** in the work-root `STATE.md § ### Tasks lifecycle` table (keyed by `task-NNN`).

If any dependency is not Done → **STOP.** List which dependencies are pending.

### Check 3: Read Minimum Grade

Run `bash .github/aid/scripts/config/read-setting.sh --skill execute --key minimum_grade --default A` to resolve the minimum grade for this skill (`.aid/settings.yml` is the source).
This is the exit criterion for the review loop.

### Check 4: Verify Not in Plan Mode

- ✅ `Default` or `Auto-accept edits` → Proceed.
- ❌ `Plan mode` → **STOP.**

### Check 5: Branch Isolation

**One branch per delivery. All tasks in a delivery share the same branch.**

1. Extract `delivery-NNN` from the task's Source field (flat path: always the
   synthesized `delivery-001`, carried by the task's `Source: ... -> delivery-001`
   field — no `deliveries/` folder to derive it from, so this step needs no change)
2. Branch name: `aid/{work}-delivery-NNN` (e.g., `aid/{work}-delivery-001`)
3. **Look up the project's VCS** from `infrastructure.md § Source Control` (via INDEX.md)
   to determine the correct branch/commit commands.

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Branch doesn't exist | Create it from current HEAD using VCS branch command |
| Branch exists, not checked out | Switch to it |
| Branch exists, already checked out | Continue |

⚠️ **Before creating a new branch:** verify working tree is clean.
If dirty → **STOP.** Ask user to commit or stash first.

**Exception:** RESEARCH and DOCUMENT tasks may not need a branch (no code changes).
If the task only produces `.aid/` artifacts, skip branch isolation.

### Check 6: Determine State

Read the task's `State`:
- **Full path:** from `deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/STATE.md` `## Task State` section, if it exists.
- **Flat path:** from the work-root `STATE.md § ### Tasks lifecycle` table row for `task-NNN`, if present.

Apply the routing table in `## State Detection` below.

Print the state-entry line and "you are here" map:

**EXECUTE:**
```
[State: EXECUTE] — Running the executor agent to produce task deliverables.
aid-execute  ▸ you are here
  [● EXECUTE ] → [ REVIEW ] → [ FIX ] → [ DONE ]
                                ↑______________|
```

**REVIEW:**
```
[State: REVIEW] — Grading task output against acceptance criteria with a clean-context reviewer.
aid-execute  ▸ you are here
  [✓ EXECUTE ] → [● REVIEW ] → [ FIX ] → [ DONE ]
                                 ↑______________|
```

**FIX:**
```
[State: FIX] — Applying CODE-issue fixes and returning to REVIEW.
aid-execute  ▸ you are here
  [✓ EXECUTE ] → [✓ REVIEW ] → [● FIX ] → [ DONE ]
                                  ↑______________|
```

**DONE:**
```
[State: DONE] — Grade meets minimum; task complete.
aid-execute  ▸ you are here
  [✓ EXECUTE ] → [✓ REVIEW ] → [✓ FIX ] → [● DONE ]
```

## State Detection

⚠️ **FILESYSTEM IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF TRUTH.** Never assume or infer state from
conversation history. Read the task's `State` from
`deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/STATE.md` `## Task State` section (full path) —
or, on the flat path, the work-root `STATE.md § ### Tasks lifecycle` row for `task-NNN`:

| Condition | State |
|-----------|-------|
| File absent or `State: _none yet_` | **EXECUTE** (Step 1) |
| `State: In Progress`, no issues pending | **EXECUTE** (Step 1 — resume) |
| `State: In Review`, issues listed | **FIX** (Step 3) |
| `State: Done` | **RE-RUN** (see Re-run below) |

## Inputs

**KB via INDEX.md** — Read `.aid/knowledge/INDEX.md`. Use summaries to decide which
KB docs are relevant to this task, then load them. Let the INDEX guide you.

**Always load (not KB):**
- Task definition — primary prompt:
  - Full path: `.aid/works/{work}/deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md`
  - Flat path: `.aid/works/{work}/tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md`
- Task mutable state (State, Review, Elapsed, Notes):
  - Full path: `.aid/works/{work}/deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/STATE.md`
  - Flat path: work-root `.aid/works/{work}/STATE.md § ### Tasks lifecycle` row for `task-NNN`
- Feature / architectural spec:
  - Full path: `.aid/works/{work}/features/{feature}/SPEC.md` — Technical Specification
  - Flat path: work-root `.aid/works/{work}/SPEC.md` — the single feature's Technical Specification
- `.aid/works/{work}/PLAN.md` — delivery context and **Execution Graph** (dependencies and parallelism;
  flat path: the top-level `## Execution Graph`, single delivery)

**Load if exists:**
- `.aid/works/{work}/known-issues.md` — issues in code the task touches

## Dispatch

| State | Detail | Worker | Advance |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| EXECUTE | `references/state-execute.md` | _(type-specific — see state file; delivery-mode uses pool dispatch PD-0→PD-6)_ | → REVIEW |
| REVIEW | `references/state-review.md` | `aid-reviewer` (Small tier, quick-check only — no grade loop per FR2) | → DONE |
| FIX | `references/state-fix.md` | _(same type as EXECUTE)_ | → REVIEW |
| DONE | _(inline — task complete)_ | `inline` | → halt |
| RE-RUN | `references/state-re-run.md` | `inline` | → halt |
| DELIVERY-GATE | `references/state-delivery-gate.md` | `aid-reviewer` (tier = complexity score) | → halt (grade ≥ min) / → FIX (grade < min) |

On state entry, print `[State: NAME]` + the "you are here" map from State Detection above.
When a state completes, route by its `**Advance:**` type (per [`state-machine-chaining.md`](../../templates/state-machine-chaining.md)):
- **CHAIN** → begin the next state's reference doc within the same invocation; no exit.
- **PAUSE-FOR-USER-ACTION** / **PAUSE-FOR-USER-DECISION** → print the pause reason + resume command and exit.
- **HALT** → print the closing summary and exit.

## Dispatch Protocol

This skill follows the L1+L2+L3 subagent-visibility protocol (work-003 traceability —
heartbeats, ETA timers, calibration). The full checklist lives in
`.github/aid/templates/dispatch-protocol-checklist.md`; read it before any subagent
dispatch in this skill.

## Workspace

```

          STATE.md              ← delivery lifecycle (SD-8, AUTHORED) + gate + Q&A + derived task rollup

          SPEC.md             ← architectural constraints (full path only)
```

**Flat (single-delivery) layout — feature-001.** Detected by: a work-root
`BLUEPRINT.md` present AND `tasks/task-NNN/DETAIL.md` present directly under
the work root AND no `deliveries/` wrapper under it. Additive alongside the
full path above (AC-9 — no regression):

```
.aid/
  works/
    work-NNN-{name}/                     (flat / single-delivery — no features/, no deliveries/)
      STATE.md                ← work-level pipeline header (AUTHORED) + the promoted
                                 ## Delivery Lifecycle (### Tasks lifecycle) /
                                 ## Delivery Gate AUTHORED blocks (single writer;
                                 replaces delivery-NNN/STATE.md + per-task STATE.md)
      REQUIREMENTS.md          ← requirements
      SPEC.md                  ← the single feature spec (no features/ folder)
      PLAN.md                  ← the single delivery's Deliverables + top-level
                                 ## Execution Graph (no ### delivery-NNN heading)
      BLUEPRINT.md              ← the single delivery definition: objective, scope,
                                 Gate Criteria, task listing, dependencies
      tasks/
        task-NNN/
          DETAIL.md            ← PRIMARY INPUT (task definition: Type, Scope, AC);
                                 NO per-task STATE.md — cells live in the work
                                 STATE.md § ### Tasks lifecycle instead
```

Branch is synthesized `aid/{work}-delivery-001` (Check 5); delivery gate criteria
come from work-root `BLUEPRINT.md § Gate Criteria` (see
`references/state-delivery-gate.md`).

**Ephemeral worktrees (pool dispatch PD-2):** `.aid/.worktrees/task-NNN/` are
temporary git worktrees provisioned for parallel pool dispatch. They are on the
shared delivery branch and are removed after the task completes (PD-4 step 5).
They are distinct from the PERSISTENT worktrees the dashboard discovers (Pillar 4
— `git worktree list`). Do not confuse the two: the ephemeral worktrees are an
execution-isolation mechanism; the persistent worktrees are a user-registered
parallel-branch mechanism visible to the dashboard.

**Nesting with the work-level worktree:** Check 1 step 3's locate+enter paragraph above already
entered this work's persistent worktree before any of the above runs, so these per-task ephemeral
worktrees are provisioned **nested, unchanged, inside** that entered work-level worktree —
different root (`.aid/.worktrees/task-NNN/` vs. the work-level `.github/worktrees/work-NNN-{name}`),
different branch, different purpose; the two compose without conflict
(`.github/aid/templates/downstream-worktree-entry.md § Composition with aid-execute's per-task
worktrees`).

## Delivery Lifecycle

Execution follows the **Execution Graph** in PLAN.md. Tasks run in dependency order.
Independent tasks (listed in the "Can Be Done In Parallel" table) can run concurrently.

```
create branch aid/{work}-delivery-001
  → /aid-execute work-001 task-001 [RESEARCH]      ← investigate → review → ✅
  → /aid-execute work-001 task-002 [DESIGN]        ← mockup → review → ✅
  → /aid-execute work-001 task-003 [IMPLEMENT]  ┐
  → /aid-execute work-001 task-004 [IMPLEMENT]  ┘  ← parallel (both depend on task-002)
  → /aid-execute work-001 task-005 [TEST]          ← waits for task-003 + task-004
  → /aid-execute work-001 task-006 [DOCUMENT]      ← ADR → review → ✅
  → merge to main
```

All tasks in a delivery accumulate on the same branch.
RESEARCH and DOCUMENT tasks that produce only `.aid/` artifacts may skip branching.

**Delivery-mode pool dispatch (FR6):** When `/aid-execute` is invoked for a
delivery (not a single task), a continuous pool dispatcher replaces the serial
loop. Full pool dispatch spec — including the `run_in_background` capability
probe and graceful degradation — lives in
`references/state-execute.md § EXECUTE-WAVE: Pool Dispatch (PD-0 through PD-6)`.

**Graceful degradation:** On hosts where the Agent tool's `run_in_background`
parameter is not supported, `aid-execute` detects this via a capability probe
(PD-0 step 2 in `references/state-execute.md`) and automatically falls back to
effective `MaxConcurrent=1`. A user-visible notice is printed:

```
[degradation] MaxConcurrent={N} requested, host capability=sequential — running effective=1
```

The degradation event is also appended to the work `STATE.md ## Calibration Log`.
The pool algorithm runs identically at pool size 1 — no behavioral difference
other than one task in flight at a time (sequential execution).

### EXECUTE-WAVE: AC4 Sub-unit Drill-down

When executing a delivery wave, render a sub-unit snapshot after each sub-unit transition.

> **Authoritative spec:** `references/state-execute-drilldown.md`
> contains the full snapshot format, status-icon vocabulary, re-render trigger
> rules (1-second coalescing), serial-task fallback semantics, and failure
> tolerance. This SKILL.md section is a brief router-level pointer; do not
> duplicate the spec here — read it from state-execute-drilldown.md so the two
> stay in sync.

## Impediments

If the agent encounters something it can't resolve:

**MANDATORY, before writing the IMPEDIMENT file -- per `references/state-execute.md § MANDATORY: State-Write Protocol`:**
update the task's own State to `Failed`, whether this task is being executed
by the main/orchestrator agent directly or by a dispatched sub-agent. Do NOT
leave the task showing `In Progress`/`In Review` while an unresolved
impediment sits unaddressed -- that is exactly the "invisible/misleading task"
state the protocol exists to prevent:
```bash
bash .github/aid/scripts/execute/writeback-state.sh \
    --delivery-id DDD --task-id NNN --field State --value "Failed"
```

```markdown
# Impediment — task-NNN

**Type:** wrong-assumption | missing-dependency | architecture-conflict | kb-gap
**Description:** What happened and why the agent stopped
**Options:**
1. {Option A} — trade-offs
2. {Option B} — trade-offs
**Recommendation:** Option {N} because {reason}
```

Write to `.aid/works/{work}/IMPEDIMENT-task-NNN.md`.

Resolution by type:
- **kb-gap** → targeted `/aid-discover` → update KB → retry
- **architecture-conflict** → `/aid-specify` for the feature
- **missing-dependency** → `/aid-detail` (might need another task first)
- **wrong-assumption** → update task or SPEC, retry

After resolving: delete IMPEDIMENT file; write task State back to `In Progress`
(the same mandatory write as Step 1's EXECUTE entry — this is a fresh entry
into EXECUTE, not a continuation that can skip it); retry from Step 1.

## Output

- Artifacts appropriate to the task type (code, tests, docs, configs, research, designs)
- Grade >= minimum grade (from `bash .github/aid/scripts/config/read-setting.sh --skill execute --key minimum_grade --default A`)
- Commit messages reference task-NNN (for types that produce commits)
- `deliveries/delivery-NNN/tasks/task-NNN/STATE.md` `## Task State` updated with full review history
  (flat path: the work-root `STATE.md § ### Tasks lifecycle` row for `task-NNN`)
- `deliveries/delivery-NNN/STATE.md` `## Delivery Lifecycle` advanced (Executing -> Gated -> Done, or Blocked)
  (flat path: the work-root `STATE.md § ## Delivery Lifecycle`)
- IMPEDIMENT-task-NNN.md if blocked

## Ticket Suggestion (conditional)

If a catalogued `issue-tracker` connector exists in `.aid/connectors/` → print a suggestion:
consider updating the corresponding ticket's status via `/aid-update-ticket status` (e.g. In
Progress → Done) and, if a loopback occurred, recording context via `/aid-update-ticket
comment`. Optional, user-initiated, never auto-invoked; silent (no output) if no issue-tracker
connector is catalogued.
