  Develop an API design as a DESIGN SEED in .aid/design/api.md -- the resource shape, the
  request/response contract, and the error model. Use this skill when an endpoint's shape is
  still being worked out and you want the contract settled before anyone writes the handler.
  Grounded in the Knowledge Base (.aid/knowledge/) and the project source. It WRITES NO
  production code and NO KB document -- realize the seed into the built endpoint with
  /aid-create-api once it is ready. Produced by the aid-architect agent and independently
  verified by aid-reviewer (full verify). Allocates a work-NNN folder.

# Design API (develop a design seed, resolve nothing)

Bind **VERB=`design`**, **ARTIFACT=`api`** -- the `design` *stage* in the contract's
vocabulary -- then follow the shared contract at
`.github/aid/templates/design-lifecycle.md`. This skill binds that contract and
restates none of its rules. The seed it writes is `.aid/design/api.md`; realizing it into
the built endpoint is `/aid-create-api`'s job, not this one's.

- **Boundary vs `/aid-create-api`:** that skill *builds* the endpoint from a ready seed;
  this one only *develops* the seed. Neither resolves anything on its own -- the user
  decides when a seed is ready to realize.
- **Not a numbered pipeline phase**; does not route to `/aid-execute`.

State machine: **INTAKE -> DESIGN -> VERIFY (loop) -> PRESENT [user decides] -> DONE**, as
`design-lifecycle.md § Skill shape` defines it. Print the `[State: NAME] -- {purpose}`
entry line on each state.

---

## State: INTAKE

1. **Require a subject.** Empty argument -> ask one bootstrapping question ("What API do
   you want to design -- its resources, contract, and error model?") and wait.
2. **Allocate** through the Work Initiation Gate exactly as the contract's Allocation rule
   requires (`.github/skills/aid-design/SKILL.md` INTAKE step 4 is the shape), with
   `initiator: aid-design-api`. `phase` is not driven.
3. **Acquire `.aid/design/`** per the contract, then read `.aid/design/api.md` if a prior
   seed exists -- re-invocation iterates it rather than starting over.
4. **Classify complexity** for the `aid-architect` dispatch (verifier tier >= producer).

**Advance:** DESIGN.

---

## State: DESIGN

Dispatch **`aid-architect`** (clean context, tiered) to write or iterate
`.aid/design/api.md` in the seed shape the contract fixes (`design-seed.md`;
feature-002 §4), grounded in `.aid/knowledge/` and the project source plus any seed read
in INTAKE. What this artifact's seed must settle: **the resource shape, the
request/response contract, and the error model**; its `## Destination` names where the
built endpoint lands. **Never writes `.aid/knowledge/` and never writes production code**
-- the `design` invariant (`design-lifecycle.md`).

**Advance:** VERIFY.

---

## State: VERIFY

**Full verify**, as `design-lifecycle.md` defines it. Not clean -> loop to DESIGN; the
3-cycle circuit breaker there escalates to IMPEDIMENT + `lifecycle: Blocked`.

**Advance:** PRESENT.

---

## State: PRESENT (hard stop -- the user decides)

Set `lifecycle: Paused-Awaiting-Input`. Present the seed clearly. Assert no resolution --
the user iterates (re-invoke this skill) or realizes it now (`/aid-create-api`).

**Advance:** DONE.

---

## State: DONE

Set `lifecycle: Completed`, `updated` now, append a `## Lifecycle History` row. The seed
persists at `.aid/design/api.md`; consumption happens at `/aid-create-api`.
