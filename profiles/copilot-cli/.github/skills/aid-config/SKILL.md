# AID Project Configuration

`/aid-config` reads and writes `.aid/settings.yml` — the single source of truth
for AID pipeline settings (grades, heartbeat, project identity).

**Two modes, nothing else.**

| Invocation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/aid-config` | Show all settings as a table. On first run (no `settings.yml`), copy the template into place first, then show. |
| `/aid-config <key>` | Show the current value of `<key>`; prompt for new (with suggestions + always a free-form option); validate; write in place. |

Examples: `/aid-config name`, `/aid-config minimum_grade`,
`/aid-config source_control`.

---

## Pre-flight

- ✅ `Default` or `Auto-accept edits` → proceed
- ❌ `Plan mode` → STOP. This skill writes files.

---

## Mode 1 — Show all settings (`/aid-config`)

### Step 1: Ensure `.aid/settings.yml` exists

If `.aid/settings.yml` is missing:
- Create `.aid/` directory if absent (do NOT touch `.aid/knowledge/` or other subdirs).
- Copy `.github/aid/templates/settings.yml` → `.aid/settings.yml` verbatim.
- Print: `Created .aid/settings.yml from template.`

### Step 2: Render the table

Read `.aid/settings.yml`. Print a table with these columns:
`Key | Value`

Order: `name`, `description`, `type`, `source_control`, `minimum_grade`, `heartbeat_interval`.

If any value matches a `<placeholder>` pattern (e.g., `<project-name>`), append ` ⚠ unset` after the value.

### Step 3: Suggest commands for unset values + the general update form

After the table, ALWAYS print the line:
```
Run /aid-config <key> to update any value.
```

If ANY rows were marked `⚠ unset`, ALSO emit a copy-pasteable command per unset row, so the user can act without having to assemble the key themselves:

```
N values unset. To set them:
  /aid-config name
  /aid-config description
```

Exit. No prompt; no further interaction.

---

## Mode 2 — View/update one key (`/aid-config <key>`)

### Step 1: Validate the key argument

Accepted keys:
- `name`
- `description`
- `type`
- `source_control`
- `minimum_grade`
- `heartbeat_interval`

If the key doesn't match: print `❌ Unknown key: <key>` + the accepted list + exit.

### Step 2: Ensure `.aid/settings.yml` exists

Same as Mode 1 Step 1.

### Step 3: Read current value

Run:
```bash
bash .github/aid/scripts/config/read-setting.sh --path <key> --default '(unset)'
```

Print: `Current value of <key>: <value>`.

### Step 4: Prompt for new value

Use `AskUserQuestion` for ALL keys with:
- A `Keep current value` option (description: shows the current value)
- 2–3 suggestion options from the Suggestions table below

Each option has only `label` + `description`. **Do NOT use the `preview` field** — the preview field switches the UI to a side-by-side layout that suppresses the auto-injected `Other` free-text input. With `description` only, the standard layout shows the `Other` field automatically and the user can always type a custom value.

Do NOT add an explicit `Other` option in the options list — the tool injects it automatically (and only renders it correctly when no option carries a `preview`).

For free-text-natural keys (`name`, `description`), the Suggestions table says `(no defaults)` — render the question with just `Keep current value` + the auto-injected `Other` field; the user types their value into Other.

Question text format (keep brief, mention free-text via Other if the user might want it):

```
New value for <key>?  (pick a suggestion or type your own via 'Other')
```

### Step 5: Validate

Per the Validation table below. If invalid: print the validation error + re-prompt (loop back to Step 4).

### Step 6: Save in place

Read `.aid/settings.yml` into memory. `settings.yml` is a flat file — every user-editable
key is a top-level scalar (`<key>: <value>`), no section nesting. Replace the top-level line
for `<key>` if one is present; otherwise append a new top-level `<key>: <value>` line at the
end of the file. Preserve all other lines and inline comments exactly as they are. Use a
same-directory temp file + `mv -f` for crash-safety (POSIX atomic rename), but no lock-dir
mutex — `aid-config` is interactive single-user; concurrent writes are not a real failure mode.

### Step 7: Confirm

Print: `✓ <key>: <old> → <new>` and exit.

## Validation table

| Key | Valid values |
|---|---|
| `name` | Non-empty string, no whitespace |
| `description` | Non-empty single-line string (NO newlines — settings.yml uses inline YAML scalars) |
| `type` | `brownfield` or `greenfield` |
| `source_control` | `none`, `git`, `svn`, or `mercurial` |
| `minimum_grade` | Regex `^[A-F][+-]?$`. E-grades are accepted but rarely useful as a floor. |
| `heartbeat_interval` | Positive integer (minutes). `0` disables heartbeat. |

---

## Internal keys (producer-written — NOT user-configurable)

`/aid-config` deliberately does **not** expose these — they are absent from *Accepted keys*
(Mode 2 Step 1) **and** from the Validation table above. They are written and maintained
by pipeline producers, never by the user. Running `/aid-config knowledge` (or any
`knowledge.*` sub-path) is rejected as an unknown key (`❌ Unknown key`) — that is the
intended behavior, not a gap.

| Key | Owner / contract |
|---|---|
| `knowledge` | Nested block `{source: <default-branch>, last_update: <ISO-8601 commit date>, doc_set: [...], term_exclusions: [...]}`. `knowledge.source` (the branch compared for KB freshness) and `knowledge.last_update` are written by `aid-discover` (on KB approval, FR35) and `aid-housekeep` (re-stamp on KB-DELTA refresh, FR36); read by the dashboard reader for outdated-detection (feature-007 FF-A2). `knowledge.doc_set` and `knowledge.term_exclusions` are runtime-written by `aid-discover`. Absence-tolerant — a missing `knowledge` block means "no baseline recorded" and the reader stays `approved`. Producer write-path (R13): the first write is a multi-line nested block (`source:` + `last_update:` + `doc_set:` + `term_exclusions:`) via the append-block idiom; a later `last_update` re-stamp is a single-line replace of that nested line. |

---

## Suggestions table (for Mode 2 AskUserQuestion)

| Key | Suggestions |
|---|---|
| `name` | (no defaults — user types their own) |
| `description` | (no defaults — user types their own) |
| `type` | `brownfield`, `greenfield` |
| `source_control` | `none`, `git`, `svn`, `mercurial` |
| `minimum_grade` | `A+`, `A`, `B+` |
| `heartbeat_interval` | `0` (disabled), `1`, `5` |

Always include a `Keep current value` option and let `AskUserQuestion`'s built-in `Other` field handle free-form input.

---

## How consumer skills read settings

Consumer skills (`/aid-discover`, `/aid-execute`, etc.) resolve `minimum_grade` using this order:

1. **`minimum_grade` in `.aid/settings.yml`** — use if present
2. **Hardcoded skill default** — use only if `.aid/settings.yml` is missing entirely, or the key is unset

The canonical resolution helper is `.github/aid/scripts/config/read-setting.sh`. Consumer skills invoke:

```bash
bash .github/aid/scripts/config/read-setting.sh --key minimum_grade --default A
```

---

## Schema reference

Canonical schema: `.github/aid/templates/settings.yml`. Flat top-level scalar keys
(`name`, `description`, `type`, `source_control`, `minimum_grade`, `heartbeat_interval`) as
described in the tables above. The `knowledge:` block is producer-written — see
*Internal keys* above, not user-configurable via this skill.
