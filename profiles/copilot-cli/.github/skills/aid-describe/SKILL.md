# Conversational Requirements Gathering

## Agents Involved

aid-describe is **multi-agent** — different states use different agents.

| State | Phase | Agent | Why |
|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| 1–4, TRIAGE | Conversational interview + triage | `aid-interviewer` | Empathetic dialogue, deterministic routing |
| L1 CONDENSED-INTAKE | Lite-path condensed interview | `aid-interviewer` | Sub-path-specific slot-fill dialogue |
| L2 TASK-BREAKDOWN | Lite-path task design | `aid-architect` | Design work — proposing typed task breakdown |
| L3 LITE-REVIEW | Lite-path pre-execution gate | `aid-reviewer` | Adversarial validation of task set against SPEC |
| L4 LITE-DONE | Lite-path terminal | (no dispatch) | Hand-off prompt to `/aid-execute` |
| DESCRIBE-SEED | Greenfield KB seed authoring (aid-describe step per D3) | `aid-interviewer` + dispatches `aid-reviewer` for step 5 | Engine-driven 5-element seed elicitation + doc authoring + coherence check + greenfield-mode review gate |

The frontmatter default `agent: aid-interviewer` covers States 1–4, TRIAGE, and L1. L2 dispatches `aid-architect`; L3 dispatches `aid-reviewer`. L4 runs inline.

Gather requirements from a human stakeholder through the **seasoned-analyst elicitation
engine** (`references/elicitation-engine.md`): one fixed D1 opener followed by a
deterministic five-step next-move selector that adapts each question to the current gap,
calibration state, and move playbook (`references/move-playbook.md`,
`references/calibration.md`, `references/advisor-stance.md`). One question per turn.
Builds REQUIREMENTS.md incrementally -- each confirmed answer updates the document
immediately.

**Workspace structure (full path):**
```
.aid/
  knowledge/           <- shared KB (populated by /aid-discover)
  work-001-name/       <- one work = one interview cycle
    STATE.md           <- process (§§ Triage, Interview State, Cross-phase Q&A, Features State...)
    REQUIREMENTS.md    <- product (clean document, only project information)
    features/          <- product (one folder per feature, created by /aid-define)
      feature-001-name/
        SPEC.md        <- product (technical specification, added by /aid-specify)
```

**Workspace structure (lite path):**
```
.aid/
  knowledge/           <- shared KB (populated by /aid-discover)
  work-001-name/       <- one lite work
    STATE.md           <- process (Pipeline State, Triage, Lifecycle History -- derived views)
    SPEC.md            <- the ONE consolidated work-root spec (lite path only)
    delivery-001/
      SPEC.md          <- delivery definition (scope, tasks, gate criteria)
      STATE.md         <- delivery lifecycle + gate block + Cross-phase Q&A + derived task rollup
      tasks/
        task-001/
          SPEC.md      <- task definition (6-section schema)
          STATE.md     <- task mutable state (State, Review, Elapsed, Notes, findings, dispatch log)
        task-002/
          SPEC.md
          STATE.md
        ...
```

A lite work has **no `features/` folder, no per-feature `SPEC.md`, no `REQUIREMENTS.md`, no `PLAN.md`** — just the work-root `SPEC.md` and the `delivery-001/` folder hierarchy.

**First run:** Conversational interview from scratch.
**Subsequent runs (before approval):** Resume interview for incomplete sections.
**After approval:** Approved REQUIREMENTS.md is ready — run `/aid-define {work}` to decompose into features.
**Loopback:** Process Q&A injected by downstream phases (e.g., `/aid-specify`).

## ⚠️ Pre-flight Checks

### Check 1: Verify Workspace Exists

Check if `.aid/` directory exists. If it doesn't:
```
⚠️ AID workspace not found. Run /aid-config first to set up the project.
```
Exit. Do not proceed.

### Check 2: Verify Not in Plan Mode

- ✅ `Default` or `Auto-accept edits` → Proceed.
- ❌ `Plan mode` → **STOP.** Tell the user to switch out of Plan Mode.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `work-NNN` | Work on the specified work item. |
| `--reset work-NNN` | Delete the work folder and restart from scratch. |
| *(no argument)* | Task routing (see below). |

---

## Task Routing

When no work ID is provided:

### No tasks exist

If `.aid/` has no `work-*` directories:

1. Ask for a short name for this work:
   ```
   What's a short name for this work? (e.g., "user-auth", "reporting", "api-v2")
   ```
2. Create `.aid/work-001-{name}/`
3. Proceed to State Detection with this work.

### Tasks exist

If `.aid/` has one or more `work-*` directories:

```
Existing works:
  work-001-user-auth   [Status: Approved, 3 features]
  work-002-reporting   [Status: In Progress, §5 Partial]

[1] Continue work-001-user-auth
[2] Continue work-002-reporting
[3] Create new work
```

Wait for response:
- **Continue existing:** proceed to State Detection for that work
- **Create new:** ask for name, create `work-{N+1}-{name}/`, proceed

**Shortcut:** If only one work exists and it's not yet Approved, go directly to it
without asking.

---

## State Detection

⚠️ **FILESYSTEM IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF TRUTH.**
Do NOT rely on memory from previous runs. ALWAYS read the actual files on disk.

All paths below are relative to `.aid/{work}/`.

```plaintext
State 1:  No STATE.md (§ Interview State)                           -> FIRST-RUN
State 2:  STATE.md § Cross-phase Q&A has Pending entries            -> Q-AND-A
State T:  STATE.md § Triage absent or § Triage **Path:** missing    -> TRIAGE
State L1: **Path:** lite, SPEC.md § Acceptance Criteria absent      -> CONDENSED-INTAKE
State L2: **Path:** lite, SPEC.md § Acceptance Criteria present,
          delivery-001/tasks/ absent or empty (no task-NNN/ dirs)  -> TASK-BREAKDOWN
State L3: **Path:** lite, delivery-001/tasks/ present,
          LITE-REVIEW not complete                                  -> LITE-REVIEW
State L4: **Path:** lite, LITE-REVIEW complete                      -> LITE-DONE
State 3:  **Path:** full, Interview State: In Progress, incomplete  -> CONTINUE
State GS: **Path:** full, Interview State: In Progress, all done,
          greenfield (no brownfield KB on disk) + seed not complete -> DESCRIBE-SEED
State 4:  **Path:** full, Interview State: In Progress, all done,
          not greenfield OR seed already complete                   -> COMPLETION
Approved: **Path:** full, Interview State: Approved                 -> hand-off to /aid-define
```

**Detection logic:**

1. If `--reset` → delete the work folder → recreate → proceed as State 1
2. Check for `STATE.md` in the work folder and look for the `## Interview State` section
3. If missing → **State 1: FIRST-RUN**
4. If exists:
   a. Check `## Cross-phase Q&A` section for entries with `**Status:** Pending`
   b. If Pending entries exist → **State 2: Q-AND-A**
   c. Check `## Triage` section for a populated `**Path:**` field
      - If `## Triage` section is absent **or** `**Path:**` field is missing/empty → **State T: TRIAGE**
        (Exception: if `## Interview State` exists and is not an empty scaffold — i.e., any
        section has status other than `Pending` — treat absent `**Path:**` as `full` and skip
        TRIAGE, to preserve backward compatibility with pre-TRIAGE in-flight works.)
   d. Read `**Path:**` from `## Triage`
   e. **If `**Path:** lite`** — route through lite-path detection:
      - Check work-root `SPEC.md` (`.aid/{work}/SPEC.md`):
        - If absent **or** `## Acceptance Criteria` section is absent/empty → **State L1: CONDENSED-INTAKE**
      - Check `delivery-001/tasks/` folder:
        - If `delivery-001/tasks/` absent or no `task-NNN/` subdirectories present → **State L2: TASK-BREAKDOWN**
      - Check `STATE.md ## Lifecycle History` for a `LITE-REVIEW complete` entry:
        - If absent → **State L3: LITE-REVIEW**
        - If present → **State L4: LITE-DONE**
   f. **If `**Path:** escalated`** — check for incomplete escalation first:
      - Check if `.aid/{work}/SPEC.md` (work-root) still exists.
      - If **`Path: escalated` AND work-root `SPEC.md` still exists** → the
        final delete step (Step 9c of `lite-to-full-escalation.md`) did not
        complete (crash recovery). Replay escalation steps 9a–9c idempotently:
        ensure `features/feature-001-*/SPEC.md` placeholder exists, ensure
        `PLAN.md` placeholder exists, then delete the work-root `SPEC.md`.
        After replay, continue to full-path detection below.
      - Then route through full-path detection as `Path: full`:

   **If `**Path:** full` (or `escalated` after crash-recovery check above)** — route through full-path detection.
      `Path: escalated` is treated identically to `Path: full`. The `## Escalation Carry`
      block in STATE.md provides context for CONTINUE to avoid re-asking questions that
      were already answered during the lite-path session.
      - Read `**Interview State:**` field in `## Interview State`
      - If State is `In Progress`:
        - Read Section Status table under `## Interview State`
        - If any section is `Pending` or `Partial` → **State 3: CONTINUE**
        - If all sections are `Complete` or `N/A`:
          **Greenfield check:** read `.aid/knowledge/` -- if no `.md` files are present OR every
          `.md` file present carries `source: forward-authored` (authored by DESCRIBE-SEED in a
          prior session), the project is greenfield (no brownfield KB on disk). If any file
          carries `source: hand-authored` or `source: generated`, the project is brownfield.
          **Seed check:** read STATE.md `## Seed Authoring` `**Status:**`. If the section is
          absent or its value is not `Complete`, the seed is not yet done.
          - If greenfield AND seed not done → **State GS: DESCRIBE-SEED**
          - Otherwise → **State 4: COMPLETION**
      - If State is `Approved`:
        - Print: `[aid-describe] Requirements for {work} are approved. Run /aid-define {work} to decompose into features.`

## Dispatch

| State | Detail | Worker | Advance |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| FIRST-RUN | `references/state-first-run.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → TRIAGE |
| Q-AND-A | `references/state-q-and-a.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → TRIAGE |
| TRIAGE | `references/state-triage.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → CONDENSED-INTAKE (Path: lite) / → CONTINUE (Path: full) |
| CONDENSED-INTAKE | `references/state-condensed-intake.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → TASK-BREAKDOWN |
| TASK-BREAKDOWN | `references/state-task-breakdown.md` | `aid-architect` | → LITE-REVIEW |
| LITE-REVIEW | `references/state-lite-review.md` | `aid-reviewer` | → LITE-DONE (grade ≥ min) / → CONDENSED-INTAKE (grade < min, loopback). User-driven escalate → CONTINUE handled separately via `lite-to-full-escalation.md`. |
| LITE-DONE | `references/state-lite-done.md` | `inline` | → halt |
| CONTINUE | `references/state-continue.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → DESCRIBE-SEED (greenfield: no brownfield KB on disk and seed not yet complete) / → COMPLETION (brownfield or seed already complete) |
| DESCRIBE-SEED | `references/state-describe-seed.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → COMPLETION |
| COMPLETION | `references/state-completion.md` | `aid-interviewer` | PAUSE-FOR-USER-DECISION → Run /aid-define {work} |

On state entry, print `[State: NAME]` + the "you are here" map from State Detection above.
When a state completes, route by its `**Advance:**` type (per [`state-machine-chaining.md`](../../templates/state-machine-chaining.md)):
- **CHAIN** → begin the next state's reference doc within the same invocation; no exit.
- **PAUSE-FOR-USER-ACTION** / **PAUSE-FOR-USER-DECISION** → print the pause reason + resume command and exit.
- **HALT** → print the closing summary and exit.

**User-driven escalate-to-full (lite → full):** Not represented as a dispatch-row branch (per feature-002 SPEC: Conditional advance is for *computed* criteria only, never user input). From any lite-path state (CONDENSED-INTAKE / TASK-BREAKDOWN / LITE-REVIEW / LITE-DONE), if the user invokes escalate, the orchestrator loads `references/lite-to-full-escalation.md` (a state-detection-driven re-entry), which writes `Path: escalated` to STATE.md and routes to CONTINUE on the next run.

## Scripts

This skill ships executable helpers in `scripts/`:

| Script | Used by | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `.github/aid/scripts/interview/parse-recipe.sh` | State TRIAGE (Step 5a recipe-offer + slot-fill + emit) | Parses canonical recipe files (YAML front-matter validation, slot extraction, `## spec`/`## tasks` block split, `{!{` escape handling, render with slot substitution). |
| `tests/canonical/test-parse-recipe.sh` | smoke test (CI / pre-commit) | 111-assertion smoke harness for `parse-recipe.sh` (maintainer-only; not shipped to adopters). |

## Targeted Interview (Loopback Re-entry)

When a downstream phase (e.g., `/aid-specify`) needs clarification on requirements:

1. The calling phase writes Q&A entries directly to the work's STATE.md
   in the `## Cross-phase Q&A` section
2. Next `/aid-describe {work}` run detects Pending Q&A → enters State 2 (Q-AND-A)
3. Questions are presented to the user one at a time
4. Answers are recorded in STATE.md `## Cross-phase Q&A` and REQUIREMENTS.md
5. Feature SPEC.md files are updated if the answer affects a specific feature

**Q&A entry format for downstream phases to write:**

```markdown
### Q{N}

- **Category:** {category, e.g., Architecture, Requirements, Security}
- **Impact:** {High|Medium|Low|Required}
- **Status:** Pending
- **Context:** {why this matters — what the downstream phase found; cite the calling phase, e.g., "Surfaced by /aid-specify work-001/feature-001"}
- **Suggested:** {answer if inferrable, or "—"}
```
