# Conversational Requirements Gathering

## Agents Involved

aid-describe is **multi-agent** — different states use different agents.

| State | Phase | Agent | Why |
|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| 1–4 | Conversational interview | `aid-interviewer` | Empathetic dialogue, deterministic advancing |
| DESCRIBE-SEED | Greenfield KB seed authoring (aid-describe step per D3) | `aid-interviewer` + dispatches `aid-reviewer` for step 5 | Engine-driven 5-element seed elicitation + doc authoring + coherence check + greenfield-mode review gate |

The frontmatter default `agent: aid-interviewer` covers States 1–4. DESCRIBE-SEED also uses `aid-interviewer`, additionally dispatching `aid-reviewer` for its step 5 greenfield-mode review gate.

Gather requirements from a human stakeholder through the **seasoned-analyst elicitation
engine** (`references/elicitation-engine.md`): one fixed D1 opener followed by a
deterministic five-step next-move selector that adapts each question to the current gap,
calibration state, and move playbook (`references/move-playbook.md`,
`references/calibration.md`, `references/advisor-stance.md`). One question per turn.
Builds REQUIREMENTS.md incrementally -- each confirmed answer updates the document
immediately.

**Workspace structure:**
```
.aid/
  knowledge/           <- shared KB (populated by /aid-discover)
  work-001-name/       <- one work = one interview cycle
    STATE.md           <- process (§§ Interview State, Cross-phase Q&A, Features State...)
    REQUIREMENTS.md    <- product (clean document, only project information)
    features/          <- product (one folder per feature, created by /aid-define)
      feature-001-name/
        SPEC.md        <- product (technical specification, added by /aid-specify)
```

**First run:** Conversational interview from scratch.
**Subsequent runs (before approval):** Resume interview for incomplete sections.
**After approval:** Approved REQUIREMENTS.md is ready — run `/aid-define {work}` to decompose into features.
**Loopback:** Process Q&A injected by downstream phases (e.g., `/aid-specify`).

**Not sure where to start?** If you don't know whether this is a full requirements
gathering effort or a small single-purpose change, run `/aid-triage` first — it
suggests the right entry (a specific shortcut, or this skill) from a one-line
description.

## ⚠️ Pre-flight Checks

### Check 1: Verify Workspace Exists

Check if `.aid/` directory exists. If it doesn't:
```
⚠️ AID workspace not found. Run /aid-config first to set up the project.
```
Exit. Do not proceed.

### Check 2: Verify Not in Plan Mode

- ✅ `Default` or `Auto-accept edits` → Proceed.
- ❌ `Plan mode` → **STOP.** Tell the user to switch out of Plan Mode.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `work-NNN` | Work on the specified work item. |
| `--reset work-NNN` | Delete the work folder and restart from scratch. |
| *(no argument)* | Task routing (see below). |

---

## Task Routing

When no work ID is provided, consult the shared **Work Initiation Gate**
(`.github/aid/templates/work-initiation-gate.md`) before doing anything else. Run its
enumeration helper (which scans `.aid/works/*` across the main tree **and every git
worktree**):

```bash
bash .github/aid/scripts/works/enumerate-works.sh
```

### No works exist (empty output) -> NEW, no prompt

1. Ask for a short name for this work:
   ```
   What's a short name for this work? (e.g., "user-auth", "reporting", "api-v2")
   ```
2. Create `.aid/works/work-001-{name}/`
3. Proceed to State Detection with this work.

### One or more works exist -> ASK (never auto-continue)

Present the gate's single new-vs-continuation question, showing the enumerated list
(group by `work_id`; annotate each with its `[phase · lifecycle]` and worktree/branch
label from the helper's record columns):

```
Works already exist. Is this a NEW work, or a CONTINUATION of an existing one?

Existing works:
  work-001-user-auth        [Describe · Running]                (main)
  work-002-reporting        [Plan · Running]                    (main)
  work-016-numberless-...   [Specify · Paused-Awaiting-Input]   (worktree: work-016)

[N] New work
[1] Continue work-001-user-auth
[2] Continue work-002-reporting
[3] Continue work-016-numberless-...
```

Wait for the response, then act per the gate:

- **New work:** ask for a name, create `.aid/works/work-{N+1}-{name}/`, proceed to State
  Detection.
- **Continuation:** route per the chosen work's `STATE.md` `phase`/`lifecycle` (gate
  Step 3b). When the gate resolves to **`/aid-describe <work>`** (the chosen work is a
  Describe-phase work), proceed straight to **State Detection** for that work in this
  same invocation -- that IS aid-describe resuming. When it resolves to a **different**
  door (a later-phase full-path work, or a halted shortcut work -> `/aid-execute`), print
  the resolved resume command and STOP; do not create or drive a work here.

> There is **no** auto-continue shortcut: a lone unapproved work is never silently
> resumed. The gate always asks when any work exists (deliberate UX change; the previous
> "if only one work exists and it's not yet Approved, go directly to it" behavior is
> removed).

## State Detection

⚠️ **FILESYSTEM IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF TRUTH.**
Do NOT rely on memory from previous runs. ALWAYS read the actual files on disk.

All paths below are relative to `.aid/works/{work}/`.

```plaintext
State 1:  No STATE.md (§ Interview State)                           -> FIRST-RUN
State 2:  STATE.md § Cross-phase Q&A has Pending entries            -> Q-AND-A
State 3:  Interview State: In Progress, incomplete                  -> CONTINUE
State GS: Interview State: In Progress, all done,
          greenfield (no brownfield KB on disk) + seed not complete -> DESCRIBE-SEED
State 4:  Interview State: In Progress, all done,
          not greenfield OR seed already complete                   -> COMPLETION
Approved: Interview State: Approved                                 -> hand-off to /aid-define
```

**Detection logic:**

1. If `--reset` → delete the work folder → recreate → proceed as State 1
2. Check for `STATE.md` in the work folder and look for the `## Interview State` section
3. If missing → **State 1: FIRST-RUN**
4. If exists:
   a. Check `## Cross-phase Q&A` section for entries with `**Status:** Pending`
   b. If Pending entries exist → **State 2: Q-AND-A**
   c. Read `**Interview State:**` field in `## Interview State`
      - If State is `In Progress`:
        - Read Section Status table under `## Interview State`
        - If any section is `Pending` or `Partial` → **State 3: CONTINUE**
        - If all sections are `Complete` or `N/A`:
          **Greenfield check:** read `.aid/knowledge/` -- if no `.md` files are present OR every
          `.md` file present carries `source: forward-authored` (authored by DESCRIBE-SEED in a
          prior session), the project is greenfield (no brownfield KB on disk). If any file
          carries `source: hand-authored` or `source: generated`, the project is brownfield.
          **Seed check:** read STATE.md `## Seed Authoring` `**Status:**`. If the section is
          absent or its value is not `Complete`, the seed is not yet done.
          - If greenfield AND seed not done → **State GS: DESCRIBE-SEED**
          - Otherwise → **State 4: COMPLETION**
      - If State is `Approved`:
        - Print: `[aid-describe] Requirements for {work} are approved. Run /aid-define {work} to decompose into features.`
        - HALT

Print the state-entry line and "you are here" map. Examples for each state:

**FIRST-RUN:**
```
[State: FIRST-RUN] — Start a new interview from scratch; create STATE.md and REQUIREMENTS.md scaffold.
aid-describe  ▸ you are here
  [● FIRST-RUN ] → [ Q-AND-A ] → [ CONTINUE ] → [ COMPLETION ] → [ /aid-define ]
```

**Q-AND-A:**
```
[State: Q-AND-A] — Resolve pending cross-phase questions before continuing.
aid-describe  ▸ you are here
  [✓ FIRST-RUN ] → [● Q-AND-A ] → [ CONTINUE ] → [ COMPLETION ] → [ /aid-define ]
```

**CONTINUE:**
```
[State: CONTINUE] — Resume the conversational interview for incomplete sections.
aid-describe  ▸ you are here
  [✓ FIRST-RUN ] → [✓ Q-AND-A ] → [● CONTINUE ] → [ COMPLETION ] → [ /aid-define ]
```

**COMPLETION:**
```
[State: COMPLETION] — All sections captured; run KB hydration and present requirements for approval.
aid-describe  ▸ you are here
  [✓ FIRST-RUN ] → [✓ Q-AND-A ] → [✓ CONTINUE ] → [● COMPLETION ] → [ /aid-define ]
```

**DESCRIBE-SEED (greenfield full path — between CONTINUE and COMPLETION):**
```
[State: DESCRIBE-SEED] — Authoring forward-authored KB seed from elicited intent (greenfield mode).
aid-describe  ▸ you are here
  [✓ FIRST-RUN ] → [✓ Q-AND-A ] → [✓ CONTINUE ] → [● DESCRIBE-SEED ] → [ COMPLETION ] → [ /aid-define ]
  (greenfield seed authoring: 5-element seed + coherence check + greenfield-mode review gate)
```

## Dispatch

| State | Detail | Worker | Advance |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| FIRST-RUN | `references/state-first-run.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → CONTINUE |
| Q-AND-A | `references/state-q-and-a.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → CONTINUE |
| CONTINUE | `references/state-continue.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → DESCRIBE-SEED (greenfield: no brownfield KB on disk and seed not yet complete) / → COMPLETION (brownfield or seed already complete) |
| DESCRIBE-SEED | `references/state-describe-seed.md` | `aid-interviewer` | → COMPLETION |
| COMPLETION | `references/state-completion.md` | `aid-interviewer` | PAUSE-FOR-USER-DECISION → Run /aid-define {work} |

On state entry, print `[State: NAME]` + the "you are here" map from State Detection above.
When a state completes, route by its `**Advance:**` type (per [`state-machine-chaining.md`](../../templates/state-machine-chaining.md)):
- **CHAIN** → begin the next state's reference doc within the same invocation; no exit.
- **PAUSE-FOR-USER-ACTION** / **PAUSE-FOR-USER-DECISION** → print the pause reason + resume command and exit.
- **HALT** → print the closing summary and exit.

## Targeted Interview (Loopback Re-entry)

When a downstream phase (e.g., `/aid-specify`) needs clarification on requirements:

1. The calling phase writes Q&A entries directly to the work's STATE.md
   in the `## Cross-phase Q&A` section
2. Next `/aid-describe {work}` run detects Pending Q&A → enters State 2 (Q-AND-A)
3. Questions are presented to the user one at a time
4. Answers are recorded in STATE.md `## Cross-phase Q&A` and REQUIREMENTS.md
5. Feature SPEC.md files are updated if the answer affects a specific feature

**Q&A entry format for downstream phases to write:**

```markdown
### Q{N}

- **Category:** {category, e.g., Architecture, Requirements, Security}
- **Impact:** {High|Medium|Low|Required}
- **Status:** Pending
- **Context:** {why this matters — what the downstream phase found; cite the calling phase, e.g., "Surfaced by /aid-specify work-001/feature-001"}
- **Suggested:** {answer if inferrable, or "—"}
```
